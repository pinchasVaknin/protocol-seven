/**
 * Another player, drawn from snapshots (M10, S6.5).
 *
 * A `RenderableActor`, so `BotRenderer` draws it with the M3 bot mesh, the M3 stance
 * handling and the M3 fall animations — S6.5 forbids a second player model and this is how
 * that is satisfied: there is no second model, only a second *source of poses*.
 *
 * ## Interpolated, never predicted
 *
 * S4.12 splits the two code paths and this is the interpolated one. The pose comes out of an
 * `EntityInterpolator` at a render time ~100 ms in the past; nothing here extrapolates from
 * inputs, because a remote player's inputs are not knowable. The consequence — that everyone
 * else is drawn slightly in the past — is not a defect to be corrected: the server rewinds to
 * exactly this time when resolving shots (S4.13), so what the player aims at is what the
 * server tests against.
 *
 * ## The rig follows the drawn pose
 *
 * A `HitboxRig` is kept in step with what is on screen, and it is used for **nothing
 * authoritative** — the server owns hit registration. It exists so the client can run its own
 * predicted trace for an immediate hitmarker (S6.4) against the same body the player can see,
 * and so the rewind debug panel has something to draw a box around.
