/**
 * The world a match is played in, as one object with one lifetime (M7).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * M4 made the world per-match: the map, the player, the match and all of its debug tooling
 * are built on entering MATCH and **fully disposed on leaving SUMMARY**, because S6.3 says
 * loading a map twice must not double anything. That was implemented as `buildWorld` and
 * `teardownWorld` inside `Game.ts` plus six nullable fields, and by M6 those six fields were
 * woven through `simulate`, `draw`, five state handlers and eight getters — around thirty
 * call sites, every one of them an optional chain on a field that is either all present or
 * all absent. `Game.ts` reached 905 lines and PLAN.md named the split as the first M7 job.
 *
 * The fix is not to move code, it is to move the *nullability*. Six fields that are always
 * null together are one field that is sometimes null, so `Game` now holds a single
 * `MatchWorld | null` and asks once. Inside here nothing is optional: a `MatchWorld` that
 * exists has a map, a player, a match and a debug suite, which is why this file has no `?.`
 * in it and why `Game.simulate` no longer has four.
 *
 * ## The mirror rule still holds
 *
 * The constructor and `dispose` are exact mirrors — every field the one sets, the other
 * clears; every group the one adds to the scene, the other removes. That is the property
 * `MatchHarness` is really testing when it runs three matches and logs the heap at each
 * boundary, and it is easier to check now that both halves are adjacent in one file instead
 * of ninety lines apart in the state machine.
 *
 * What deliberately does **not** live here is anything genuinely process-wide: the renderer,
 * the textures, the audio graph, the input listener, the frame-stats buffer, the profile and
 * the config objects the tuning panel holds references to. Those are handed in.

   * The networked half of it used to have only the last two branches, and the first one was
