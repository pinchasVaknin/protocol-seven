/**
 * The server's answer to every streak question a networked client used to answer itself

 *
 * ## Why this exists rather than the client's own `StreakSystem`
 *
 * A networked client still constructs a `StreakSystem` — it is the object the HUD, the minimap
 * and the renderer were all written against — and in a networked match it is **not simulated**.
 * That leaves every one of its readers asking a system that will never advance: what have I
 * earned, is my minimap scrambled, where is the sweep, what is on the floor.
 *
 * This is the replica those readers are pointed at instead. §4.15 puts *"killstreak earn,
 * activation, entity state"* on the replicated side of the line, and a client that folded its
 * own kill events into its own streak counter would be a second authority that agrees with the
 * first right up until it does not — the same shape as the Domination flags, arriving from the
 * other direction.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not hold
 *
 * No timers, no expiry, no sweep advance. Everything here is overwritten wholesale by the next
 * `Streaks` frame at the snapshot rate, and a value interpolated between two of them would be a
 * number this client invented. The sweep bearing is the one place that shows — the beam steps at
 * 20 Hz rather than 60 — and that is the correct trade: a beam that is a frame stale is
 * invisible, and a beam the client advanced on its own would drift away from the contacts the
 * server recorded against it.
