/**
 * Every query-string flag this client understands, declared once (playtest round 5, B9).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * B9 reported two documented flags not doing what `README.md` said. One of them —
 * `?name=ALICE` — was worse than not working: `parseJoinOptions` read it and its only caller
 * overwrote the result on the next line, so the parse was **dead code that the documentation
 * described as a feature**. The other — `?server=1` — worked exactly as written and had never
 * promised what the prose around the table implied.
 *
 * Neither is a parsing bug. The defect is that the flag table was a piece of prose in a
 * README with nothing checking it against the parser, so a flag could be documented into
 * existence and stay that way for a milestone. `URL_FLAGS` is the declaration both sides are
 * held to: `scripts/check-flags.mjs` fails when the README's table and this list disagree in
 * either direction, and when any file under `src/client/` reads a query key that appears in
 * neither this list nor `UNDOCUMENTED_URL_KEYS`.
 *
 * ## Why it is in `shared/`
 *
 * The flags are parsed on the client, but two of the rules they encode are shared with the
 * server and were duplicated there: the name sanitiser existed character-for-character twice
 * (`JoinOptions` and `net/Session`), and the `#rw` suffix string existed three times. A rule
 * with two spellings is two rules, which is the finding this milestone keeps making. Nothing
 * here touches `URLSearchParams` or the DOM — the caller does the parsing and passes strings
 * in — so it compiles under `shared/`'s no-DOM library.
