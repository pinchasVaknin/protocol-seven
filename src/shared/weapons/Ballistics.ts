/**
 * Hitscan ballistics (brief S4.4).
 *
 * All weapons are hitscan. At 800 m/s across a 50 m lane a simulated round takes 60 ms
 * to arrive, and players read that as "my shots aren't registering" — so the round lands
 * on the tick it is fired and the tracer is a visual that catches up afterwards.
 *
 * The trace walks the same 4 m spatial hash the collision broadphase uses (S4.3), never
 * `THREE.Raycaster`, and interleaves world geometry with damageable rigs so a round that
 * punches through a thin wall goes on to hit whatever is standing behind it.
 *
 * Allocation free: every record here is owned by the instance and reused.
