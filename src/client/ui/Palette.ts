/**
 * Every colour that carries **gameplay meaning**, in one place (brief S6.3).
 *
 * ## Why this is not a CSS filter
 *
 * S6.3 is explicit: colorblind mode must affect "the actual team colours, hitmarkers,
 * minimap and objective indicators, not just a CSS filter over everything". The difference
 * is not cosmetic. A filter is a fixed transform applied after the fact, so it moves *every*
 * colour including the ones that were already distinguishable, and it cannot add contrast
 * that the source image never had: a green dot and a red dot that a deuteranope reads as two
 * identical browns are still two identical browns after any matrix you like. What works is
 * choosing different colours, and the only way to do that is to have somewhere the colours
 * are chosen.
 *
 * So this is that place, and it covers both worlds at once — the DOM (as CSS custom
 * properties, so `hud.css` keeps expressing intent rather than hex) and the 3D scene and
 * canvases (as numbers, for `THREE.Color` and `CanvasRenderingContext2D`). One palette, two
 * encodings, no possibility of the minimap disagreeing with the killfeed.
 *
 * ## What the three modes actually do
 *
 * The default pairing is blue against red: red for the enemy because that is what every
 * shooter has taught, blue for the team because it is the hue that reads as "mine" from
 * either seat and never competes with the amber objective ring. The alternatives exist
 * because red is the one half of that pair the two commonest forms of colour blindness
 * cannot rely on.
 *
 * - **Deuteranopia / protanopia** (red-green): friendly moves onto a stronger cyan-blue;
 *   hostile moves off red and onto a bright amber-orange. Blue and orange
 *   is the classic safe pair — it separates on the blue-yellow axis, which both conditions
 *   leave intact — and it also separates by *lightness*, which survives even a total loss of
 *   colour vision.
 * - **Tritanopia** (blue-yellow, rare): the safe axis is the other one, so friendly goes to
 *   a clear teal-green and hostile to a strong magenta-red. Blue would be the wrong answer
 *   here for the same reason green is wrong above.
 *
 * Neutral, warning and objective colours move with them, because an objective ring that
 * stayed amber under deuteranopia would collide with the new hostile colour — a palette is
 * a set of relationships and shifting one member without the others is how you turn one
 * indistinguishable pair into a different indistinguishable pair.
