/**
 * The shotgun (brief S6.1): 8 pellets, per-pellet damage, one-shot inside 6 m.
 *
 * `damage` here is **per pellet**, not per trigger pull, and `Ballistics` resolves each of
 * the eight as its own hitscan ray against the hitbox rig — so a spread that catches the
 * head and the chest applies the head multiplier to the pellets that hit the head and the
 * torso multiplier to the rest. A single ray with a x8 multiplier would be a completely
 * different weapon: it would either all-hit or all-miss, and the whole character of a
 * shotgun is the part that lands.
 *
 * 18 per pellet means six of eight is 108 and kills; at 6 m the cone is 0.27 m across
 * against a 0.46 m chest, so six is what you get for aiming. At 10 m the pellets have
 * fallen to 10 and the cone has opened past the silhouette, and it is a two-shot at best
 * against a 90 RPM pump.
