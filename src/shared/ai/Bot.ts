/**
 * One bot (brief S6.1).
 *
 * A bot is not a special case, and this file is where that stops being a slogan. It owns
 * the *same* three things the player owns — a `HitboxRig`, a `Health` and a
 * `WeaponSystem` — plus a real `PlayerController`. The only difference between a bot and
 * the human is where the `InputCommand` comes from: the player's arrives from
 * `core/Input`, and a bot's is written by its `BotBrain`.
 *
 * Everything falls out of that. Bots collide with the swept capsule, obey the same speed
 * table and the same 8.2 m/s bound, step up the same 0.35 m, make the same footstep
 * sounds through the same positional audio, and take and deal damage through the one door
 * in `DamageSystem` — so time-to-kill is symmetric by construction rather than by two
 * implementations agreeing. It also means the netcode seam is real (M10: `INetLink`):
 * a bot already *is* a remote command source.
 *
 * The recoil residual is the detail worth calling out. `WeaponSystem` hands back the
 * unrecovered part of each kick, and for the player that goes into the view angles. Here
 * it goes into the bot's aim, which is why a bot holding the trigger climbs off target and
 * has to fight its way back down — with exactly the numbers in the weapon def.
