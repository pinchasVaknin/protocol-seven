/**
 * MP_FOUNDRY — the M4 map (brief S6.1).
 *
 * Industrial, classic three-lane. Two outer lanes down the long sides, a tight centre hall
 * in the middle, and a catwalk deck four metres up that crosses the hall and comes down in
 * both outer lanes — so the middle is fought over on two levels and neither one owns the
 * other.
 *
 * ## The shape
 *
 * ```
 *              z = -25  (TEAM B home)
 *   +--------------------------------------+
 *   |        north yard                    |
 *   |  W  +--------------------+   E       |   x = -29 .. +29
 *   |  E  |   FOUNDRY HALL     |   A       |   z = -25 .. +25
 *   |  S  |  22 x 22, walls 3m |   S       |
 *   |  T  |  open top, ring    |   T       |   catwalk deck top y = 4.0
 *   |     |  deck at y = 4     |           |   hall walls y = 0 .. 3
 *   |  l  +--------------------+   l       |   perimeter walls 9 m
 *   |  a       south yard      a           |
 *   +--------------------------------------+
 *              z = +25  (TEAM A home)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Fairness is applied, not asserted
 *
 * The map is **rotationally symmetric**: everything but the two Search & Destroy bomb sites
 * is authored for one half and put through `rotateHalf`, which maps `(x, z) -> (-x, -z)`.
 * A mirror would have made the two teams' lanes handed — one team's cover on their left is
 * the other team's on their right — and rotation gives both sides literally the same map.
 * The four pitched surfaces are authored per side because a pitched brush cannot be rotated
 * by adding pi to its yaw (see `build.ts`).
 *
 * That is also what makes the lane timings land: the three lanes are ~21 m from a home spawn
 * to the point in that lane where the two teams meet, and both teams walk the same 21 m.
 * `FOUNDRY_LANES` names those endpoints so the debug harness can path them and report
 * seconds rather than the author claiming a number.
 *
 * ## The catwalk
 *
 * A 3 m wide ring around the inside of the hall at y = 4.0, a bridge straight across the
 * middle of it, and two ramps down into the outer lanes — plus two internal stairs, so the
 * deck has four ways on and is contested rather than camped. **Deliberately no railings.**
 * Dropping off a catwalk into the hall or into a lane is a route, and an open edge is also
 * one fewer 0.12 m ledge for the navmesh to call walkable. Cover up there comes from the
 * structural girders that pass through the deck.
 *
 * The deck is the reason this map bakes two nav layers: a column inside the hall holds the floor *and*
 * the deck above it, and a single-layer grid could only ever describe one of them.
 *
 * Convention: +X east, +Z south, Y up. Floor top is y = 0.

   * near-black ground colour means anything facing away from the sun is lit by almost
   * nothing, and on a map whose interesting spaces are all indoors that is most of it. The
   * hemisphere is now 1.35 with a ground colour lifted out of the mud, so a wall in shadow
   * still reads as a surface; the key came up a little to keep the contrast ratio, and the
   * two ladles came up because a hall competing with brighter fill needs to.
   *
   * The fog also mattered more than it looked: `fogNear` at 38 m on a 62 m map was greying
   * out the far half of every lane. Pushed back to 55.
