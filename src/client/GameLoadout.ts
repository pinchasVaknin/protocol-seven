/**
 * The bridge between the profile's equipped class and the objects a match is built from.
 *
 * Free functions rather than methods, because none of this needs the state machine — it is
 * a translation between two data shapes, and pulling it out of `Game.ts` keeps that file
 * about states and the loop.
 *
 * The subtle part is `copyWeaponDefInto`. `Game` owns three long-lived `WeaponDef` objects
 * that the tuning panel, the weapon system and the bot director captured references to when
 * the match was built; replacing one would leave three systems pointing at the previous
 * loadout. So a class change *copies into* them, which is the same trick M5's weapon picker
 * used and the reason nothing has to resubscribe when the player switches class.
