 * Application root and the top-level state machine (S6.3): BOOT -> MENU -> MATCH -> SUMMARY.
 *
 * ## The world is per-match, and it lives next door
 *
 * M1-M3 built the map, the player and the match once at boot and kept them for the life of
 * the page, because there was only ever one of each. M4 has a map *choice* and a summary
 * screen you come back from, so the world is built on entering MATCH and **fully disposed on
 * leaving SUMMARY** — S6.3's "loading a map twice must not double anything".
 *
 * M4 put that in this file as `buildWorld` / `teardownWorld` plus six nullable fields, and by
 * M6 those fields were threaded through `simulate`, `draw`, five state handlers and eight
 * getters. M7 moved the whole lifecycle to `MatchWorld`, so what is left here is the state
 * machine, the loop and the front end — and the six fields that were always null together
 * became one field that is sometimes null. Every method below asks once, at the top.
 *
 * What survives a match is what is genuinely process-wide: the renderer, the textures, the
 * audio graph, the input listener, the frame-stats buffer, the profile and the config objects
 * the tuning panel holds references to. All of them are fields here and are handed to
 * `MatchWorld` rather than owned by it. `MatchHarness` runs the build/teardown cycle
 * repeatedly and logs the heap at each boundary, which is the test that the split is honest.

  // -- the loadout doctrine -------------------------------------------------

  /*
   * Where Create-a-Class went, and the two reversals behind it (playtest round 4, B5 and B8).
   *
   * There is no `openLoadout` and no `closeLoadout` any more, and that is the change. M11 §6.6 made the editor
   * reachable from inside the warmup arena; round 2 found that every route out of it was
   * costly — Back went to `MENU` and tore the world down, Escape went to `PAUSED`, and the
   * editor's own "Start match" cleared `multiplayerJoin` and launched a solo game — and fixed
   * it by making the editor an *overlay* over the live world, so there was no transition left
   * to route wrongly.
   *
   * Round 4 asks for the opposite, and it is a design decision rather than a defect: **the
   * editor is a front-end screen, and inside a match the only way to change class is keys
   * 1-5.** So the overlay is gone rather than fixed, `LEGAL_TRANSITIONS` no longer admits
   * `MATCH -> LOADOUT` or `PAUSED -> LOADOUT`, and `Menus` is the one door.
   *
   * **What survived the removal is the half that protects the surviving path.** The deferral of
   * `meta.setLoadout` (Tier 1 #20) was built for the overlay and matters more without it: a
   * class applied to a standing body re-runs the perk hooks, one of which writes
   * `PlayerController.speedScale`, so the client predicts a speed the server — which defers to
   * the next spawn — is not simulating. That is a per-tick disagreement about how fast you are
   * moving, which is what rubberbanding is. `pickQuickClass` is now the *only* caller of that
   * pair, so `ClientMatch.applyLoadout` and `ServerMatch.setPendingLoadout` are load-bearing
   * for 1-5 alone.
   *
   * What is left in this file is `pickQuickClass` below and the `LOADOUT` state above. This
   * note is here rather than on either of them because it is about the *absence* of the code
   * that used to sit between them, and a deletion has nowhere else to be documented.

  /**
   * Every HUD surface this class owns, decided once per frame from one place.
   *
   * This is the invariant playtest round 4 asked for, and the three reports it answers were
   * all the same defect in different costumes: a surface whose visibility was written from
   * **two** places (the debug overlay, where the × wrote one copy and the pause bookkeeping
   * the other), or from a place that **stops running** at the moment the answer had to change
   * (the scoreboard, written from the sim tick, which does not tick while paused).
   *
   * The rules themselves are pure functions in `shared/ui/HudSurfaces.ts`, which is what makes
   * them measurable: `HeadlessClient` builds no `ClientMatch` and has no DOM, so a claim about
   * a panel is a browser claim — but the rule behind it is an ordinary function the harness can
   * run over a real connection across death, respawn, round end and migration. Same reasoning,
   * and the same shape, as `pickSpectatorTarget`.
   *
   * Driven from state every frame rather than opened and closed by events, for the reason
   * `syncChopperBody` gives about the chopper: each window can end four ways — the countdown
   * expires, the player respawns, the match ends, the world is torn down — and a latch would
   * have to be cleared correctly on all of them. Asked every frame, there is nothing to get
   * stuck, and a panel stuck on screen is one eating the digit keys for the rest of the match.

   * - **A local code** is applied here, because the client is its authority. It also moves
   *   `debugRequest`, and that is not a second writer of one fact: *may they* and *do they want
   *   it* are two facts, and the code is the only input that has an opinion about both.
   * - **Everything else** is a request. Connected, it goes to the server and nothing changes
