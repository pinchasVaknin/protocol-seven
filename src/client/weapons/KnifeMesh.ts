/**
 * The knife viewmodel (round 2 playtest).
 *
 * ## Why there is a mesh at all now
 *
 * Post-M8 shipped melee as a *bash*: the rifle stayed in frame and swung, because a swing is
 * cheap in transforms that already exist and a second viewmodel is a thing to build, camo,
 * dispose and keep in step with a weapon swap. That was the right call for getting the hitbox
 * and the damage door right, and QA agreed the mechanic works. What it is not is a knife —
 * the report asks for the blade — and the machinery it was avoiding turns out to be small,
 * because a knife is the one viewmodel with no moving parts: no magazine, no charging handle,
 * no muzzle, no sights, and no ADS pose to compensate for.
 *
 * So it is one static group, built once per match, hidden until `Melee.busy`. It shares the
 * weapon surfaces (see `sharedWeaponSurfaces`) so the blade is lit by the same three
 * materials the rifle is, and it is never camouflaged — a camo is a property of a weapon and
 * a knife is not one.
 *
 * ## The blade is a flattened four-gon, not a box
 *
 * Everything in this project is primitives, and a box makes a *shim*. A blade needs a section
 * that is thin across and deep top-to-bottom, coming to a point — which is exactly a
 * four-sided cylinder scaled hard in X, capped by a four-sided cone of the same section. Two
 * geometries, one merge, and the silhouette reads as a knife from the one angle that matters:
 * the lower right of the screen, mid-swing.
 *
 * Local space matches the weapon models: +X right, +Y up, **-Z forward**, roughly metres,
 * origin at the fist. The blade runs from the guard at `z = -0.072` to the point at
 * `z = -0.24`, which is a 168 mm blade — a fighting knife rather than a bayonet.

   * The forearm, which is *not* a child of `root` (round 4).
   *
   * The report was that the hand "completely detaches from the player's body" once the poses
   * moved into frame — and it did, because there was nothing behind the fist. At `READY` the
   * fist had been sitting essentially on the camera, so the cut-off wrist was behind the near
   * plane and nobody saw it; moving the pose forward to make the knife visible made the stump
   * visible with it.
   *
   * It cannot be part of `root`, because `root` rotates through 100° of yaw across the swing
   * and a rigidly attached arm would swing with it and point at the ceiling. An arm connects
   * two points — a shoulder that does not move and a fist that does — so it is built as a unit
   * length along -Z and then aimed and stretched between them each frame. `KNIFE_SHOULDER` is
   * behind the camera, so the far end is always off-screen and the arm always runs out of
   * frame at the bottom right, which is the "cutoff point hidden off-screen" the report asked
   * for.

 * being 700 mm long; a knife at the same scale is a detail, which is the "barely visible"
 * half of the report that moving it into frame does not fix. 1.3 puts the blade at 218 mm,
 * which reads as a weapon at arm's length without becoming a machete.

 * On the root, so `poseKnife` keeps writing plain position and rotation and the two concerns
