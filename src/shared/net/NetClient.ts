/**
 * The client half of the protocol (M10).
 *
 * ## Why this lives in `shared/`
 *
 * It has no browser in it. It takes an `INetLink` and drives the simulation, and both of
 * those are runtime-agnostic — so the browser client and the headless test client run
 * **exactly this code**, and a bug found by the unattended harness is a bug in the thing
 * players run. If prediction lived in `client/`, the harness could only ever test the
 * server, which is the half that was never going to be the hard part.
 *
 * The boundary check enforces the property that makes this possible: no `WebSocket`, no
 * `window`, no `performance.now()` anywhere in here.
 *
 * ## The tick loop
 *
 * ```
 *   1. poll        decode everything the link has delivered
 *   2. catch up    step the simulation forward to the tick the clock says we should be on
 *   3. send        one batch carrying the newest commands plus redundancy
 *   4. smooth      decay any correction still being eased out
 * ```
 *
 * Step 2 is where S4.11's rule bites: the target tick is **derived from the synced server
 * clock**, never incremented. If a frame took 200 ms, twelve ticks are owed and twelve are
 * run; the client does not quietly fall behind and start stamping commands for ticks the
 * server has already simulated.

   * Two cases, and both were real divergences before this existed:
   *
   * - **Frozen** (`SFlag.InputFrozen`): the pre-match countdown and the post-round pause.
   *   `ServerMatch.stepPlayer` strips the movement axes and every action bit and keeps the
   *   view angles, so looking around still works. This does the same thing to the same
   *   fields.
   * - **Dead**: `NetPlayer.step` returns before consuming a command at all, so the corpse
   *   just falls. A client predicting a dead player walking is the same divergence in a
   *   different costume.
   *
   * The view angles survive in both cases, which is what makes a countdown feel like a
   * starting gun and a death screen feel like a camera rather than a freeze frame.
   *
   * Every command passes through here, suppressed or not, because this is also where the
   * command is rounded to wire precision.
   *
   * This is the netcode-side statement of a rule the single-player build already had
   * (`Input.sampleSpectating`). Neither side owns it alone: it lives here so both halves of
   * a networked match read it from one place.
   *
   * **Except that it restated the rule and lost its exception** (playtest round 4, B6).
   * `Input.sampleSpectating` keeps `Btn.Scoreboard` through a death on purpose — the M4 note
   * that the death screen is exactly when you want to look at the board — and this zeroed the
   * whole bitfield, so on a networked client the one fact the scoreboard is derived from was
   * forced to nothing the moment the server said you were dead. The standing
   * authority-migration failure in miniature: the rule moved here, the exception did not.
   *
   * Keeping it costs no divergence and cannot. `Btn.Scoreboard` is presentation: nothing in
   * `PlayerController.step` or `Weapons.step` reads it, `NetPlayer.step` does not consume a
   * dead player's command at all, and the frozen path's `lastButtons` is only ever asked
   * whether the trigger was down. The bit rides the same bitfield as everything else because
   * S4.2 allows exactly one input path, not because the simulation wants it.
