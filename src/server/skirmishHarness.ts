/**
 * The full-flow harness (M11, §7).
 *
 * §7: *"Headless harness driving the full flow: N headless clients connecting, playing warmup,
 * voting, migrating, playing a match, and returning — unattended, under any simulated network
 * condition."*
 *
 * This is the instrument every Gate A number comes out of. It runs the **real** server and the
 * **real** client netcode — `Server`, `NetClient`, `Prediction`, `ClockSync` — over a real
 * WebSocket on loopback, with the condition simulator layered on each link. What it does not
 * have is a renderer, which affects none of the numbers below.
 *
 * ```bash
 *   npm run skirmish                       # one full cycle at shipped timings
 *   npm run skirmish -- --cycles 3         # three cycles
 *   npm run skirmish -- --leak 100         # 100 allocate/destroy cycles, heap and subs
 *   npm run skirmish -- --net bad          # 100ms +/-30ms, 2% loss on every link
 *   npm run skirmish -- --fault latency    # FaultyMatchAllocator: latency|failure|capacity
 *   npm run skirmish -- --summary-gate     # RED CONTROL: go silent for the post-match hold
 *   npm run skirmish -- --drop-return 3    # 3 drop/return cycles mid-match (F8)
 *   npm run skirmish -- --drop-return 1 --drop-hold 40000   # ...past the grace, on purpose
 *   npm run skirmish -- --cheats            # F14: RED CONTROL — the server must refuse
 *   npm run skirmish -- --cheats --cheats-on   # ...and, with the flag, must honour them
 *   npm run skirmish -- --cheats --cheats-on --cheats-early  # type it in the ARENA (F14 fix)
 *   MATCH_ROUND_SECONDS=150 npm run skirmish -- --vote 3 --wallet-streak sentry --cycles 1
 *                                          # M13 A: FFA, every client buys a sentry
 * ```
 *
 * ## Loopback proves the flow, not the netcode
 *
 * HARD RULE 9: *"Never test netcode on loopback alone."* That rule governs latency, loss and
 * rewind claims, and those are measured against the deployed server under §7's conditions. What
 * this harness proves is **structure** — that a vote resolves, that an allocation happens, that
 * every player is migrated exactly once, that nothing leaks over a hundred cycles. Those are
 * true or false independent of the wire, and the `--net` flag layers the simulated conditions
 * on when the question does depend on it.

 * import TypeScript. Watched red with the real function broken, it stayed **green**: it was
 * proving a property of its own copy. This module is compiled, so it can import the thing itself,
 * and that is the difference between a proof and a restatement.
 *
 * ## The property, and why it is exhaustive rather than sampled
 *
 * `toggleCheat` is a relative move. Toggling a multi-bit set clears it **only** from the mask that
 * already holds every bit; every other mask widens to the full set. Expressing *"turn these off"*
 * as one such toggle is what shipped: a player holding god mode alone was migrated, the teardown
 * asked to toggle all three, the request landed on a mask the migration had cleared to zero, and
 * `0 | God|Unseen|NoClip` arrived in the next match as every cheat on. One bit in, three bits out.
 *
 * `bitsClearing` is the verb that means "off". The state space is eight masks, so the property is
 * decidable rather than sampled: for **every** reachable mask, folding `toggleCheat` over its
 * answer must give exactly `0` — not "not the full mask", exactly zero. That is the assertion the
 * report asked for, over all of the inputs instead of one of them.
 *
 * Pure, allocation-light and instant, so it runs unconditionally at the top of every harness
 * invocation rather than behind a flag. A property that only holds when somebody remembers to
 * pass `--cheats` is a property that will be broken by a run that does not.
