/**
 * A connected human, on the server (M10, S4.15).
 *
 * ## It is a `Bot` with a socket where the brain would be
 *
 * That is not a figure of speech, it is the architecture. S4.15: *"A bot is a server-side
 * entity whose `BotBrain` produces `InputCommand`s fed into the exact same pipeline a remote
 * human's commands enter. This is the symmetry M3 deliberately built."* Compare this class to
 * `shared/ai/Bot.ts` and the only structural difference is where the command comes from —
 * `BotBrain.steer` there, `InputBuffer.take` here. Everything downstream is identical:
 * `PlayerController.step`, then `WeaponSystem.step`, then the rig follows the capsule.
 *
 * The consequence is the thing worth stating: a human gets recoil, spread, sprint-to-fire,
 * reload timing, slide rules and mantle detection **for free and identically**, because it is
 * not a separate implementation. That is also why S8.7 can demand identical TTK in
 * single-player and networked — there is only one weapon system, and it is this one.
 *
 * ## It is a `Combatant`
 *
 * So bots perceive it, spawn safety scores against it, and `DamageSystem` resolves rounds
 * into it, with no code in `ai/` knowing that a human is not a bot.
