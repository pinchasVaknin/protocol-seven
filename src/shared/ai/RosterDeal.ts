/**
 * How a `tierMix` becomes two teams (playtest round 5, B4).
 *
 * The report: *"the only VETERAN in the mix always falls on the opposing team"*, with two
 * matches whose rosters were byte-identical. It was not a seed and not variance.
 * `BotDirector.populate` advanced **one cursor** through the mix and filled team A to
 * completion before team B started, which makes "which side does this tier land on" a pure
 * function of the tier's *index in the mix* against `teamA`. Foundry and Dunes put `VETERAN`
 * at index 4 and a solo 5v5 deals four bots to A, so index 4 was team B's first bot. Every
 * match. The same literal, read against the other two splits, punishes the other side:
 *
 *   solo 5v5      (4 / 5)  VETERAN always on B — the report
 *   live match    (5 / 5)  VETERAN always on A, and B never gets one
 *   live FFA      (4 / 4)  VETERAN always on B
 *
 * ## The rule this file implements, and the decision inside it
 *
 * **Both sides read the mix from the same place.** The long side takes the first `max(a, b)`
 * entries of the cyclic mix; the short side takes the same entries minus the `|a - b|`
 * **weakest** of them. Two consequences, both provable rather than observed:
 *
 *  - When the sides are even they are *identical*. That is every live-server match.
 *  - When they are not, the short side's multiset is contained in the long side's and the two
 *    differ by exactly `|a - b|` entries — the fewest the head-count allows.
 *
 * The brief asked for a decision to be made out loud: *the human seat is not a bot seat*. A
 * side is short a bot precisely because something else occupies that seat — in solo, the
 * player — and a player is on average worse than a REGULAR bot, so mirroring the tiers exactly
 * still hands the other side a real edge. **The short side keeps the stronger half.** That is
 * the brief's second option, generalised so that it needs no knowledge of where the humans
 * are: at `ServerMatch.populate` there are no humans yet and team A is not "the player's
 * side", so a rule phrased in terms of the player could only have been an `if (networked)`
 * branch, which is the shape P0 bans by name. Phrased in terms of *bodies* it is one rule in
 * both runtimes: the side that is a body down keeps the better bodies.
 *
 * The rejected alternative was to vary the deal by seed. It is a non-fix: `MatchWorld.AI_SEED`
 * is a **constant**, deliberately, so every solo match would have drawn the same offset and
 * the report's "two identical rosters" would have survived the fix untouched.
 *
 * Strength order is `BOT_TIERS` itself, which is already authored weakest-first and already
 * the order the difficulty picker offers. Nothing here invents a ranking.

 * roster this side would have had at one body more, and hand back whatever this side is short
 * of. There is one description of a balanced roster in this file and every caller derives from
 * it, which is what stops the two drifting apart the way they did at round 4's F1.
 *
 * The strongest shortfall wins when a roster has drifted far enough to be short of several —
 * a side that is a body down is the side keeping the stronger half, so the body it is owed is
 * the best one it lacks. `auditRosterDeal` holds the pair to the round trip: take a bot off a
 * side the way a joining human does, ask for a replacement, and the roster comes back to what

/**
 * Every authored spread, dealt at every split, checked against four properties.
 *
 * The brief asked for *"over N seeds and every mode, the multiset of tiers on team A and on
 * team B differ by at most one entry"*. Two things about that, and both are the reason this
 * is not what got written:
 *
 *  1. **It was already true.** The shipped one-cursor deal satisfies per-tier parity on all six
 *     shipped configurations, the reported 5v5 included — `A = REGULAR HARDENED RECRUIT
 *     REGULAR` against `B = VETERAN HARDENED REGULAR RECRUIT REGULAR` is parity. An assertion
 *     of that shape would have been green on the build the report was written against, which
 *     makes it a regression guard and not a probe.
 *  2. **There is no seed to sweep.** The deal is a pure function of `(teamA, teamB, mix)`. So
 *     the sweep is over the things that actually vary — every registered spread against every
 *     split up to a full roster — which is a stronger statement than a hundred samples: it is
 *     the whole domain, so one run is a fact rather than an estimate.
 *
 * The four properties, in the order they would fail:
 *
 *  - **Sizes.** Each side gets exactly the count it asked for.
 *  - **Containment.** The short side's multiset is inside the long side's. This is what fails
 *    today on Depot, on the live 5v5 and on FFA — the two sides hold tiers the other does not.
 *  - **Minimality.** They differ by exactly `|teamA - teamB|` entries, which is the fewest the
 *    head-count allows and is zero when the sides are even.
 *  - **The short side keeps the stronger half.** Every body it does without is at least as weak
 *    as every body it keeps. This is the one that fails on the report's own roster, where the
 *    body team A did without was the VETERAN.
 *
 * Per-tier parity — the brief's own assertion — follows from containment and minimality, and is
 * asserted anyway, because a property that is implied is still a property somebody will change.
