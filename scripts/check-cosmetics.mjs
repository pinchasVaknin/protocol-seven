/**
 * The §8.25 cosmetic audit, as a check that can fail (M11 Gate B).
 *
 * §8.25: *"Cosmetic audit: no decal, tracer, particle or viewmodel state appears in any
 * snapshot."* §4.15 draws the line it is auditing:
 *
 *   Server-authoritative (replicated) | Client-only (never replicated)
 *   position, velocity, stance, aim   | tracers, muzzle flash, impact decals
 *   health, damage, death, hitreg     | particles, blood, shell ejection
 *   ammo, reload, equipped weapon     | viewmodel animation, camera shake, bob
 *   objective, scores, round state    | screen effects, vignette, tinnitus
 *   killstreak earn/activation/entity | crosshair, hitmarker, HUD
 *
 * ## Why this is an allowlist rather than a banned-word search
 *
 * A banned-word search only catches a cosmetic somebody was honest enough to name `decal`. The
 * failure that actually happens is a field called `impactX` or `shakeAmount` or `serial` that
 * nobody notices is presentation, and no keyword list anticipates it.
 *
 * So the snapshot's field set is **pinned**. Adding a field to `EntitySnapshot` fails this check
 * until it is listed below with a reason, which makes "is this gameplay or is this presentation"
 * a question somebody has to answer out loud rather than one that can be skipped by accident.
 * That is the whole mechanism, and it is the same one `check-boundaries` uses: a rule a human
 * has to remember is a rule that will be broken.
 *
 * Since M13 Phase B the scoreboard row (`ReplicatedScoreRow`, carried whole by
 * `MsgS.Scoreboard`) is pinned the same way, under the same table's "scores" row.
