/**
 * Open a connection and find out what match is running, *before* building a world (M10,
 * playtest round 2).
 *
 * ## The ordering bug this file exists to fix
 *
 * `MatchWorld`'s constructor loaded a map, spawned the player into it, built the match — and
 * only then dialled the server. The map it loaded came from `Game.selection`, which is the
 * *client's own menu choice*, saved in the local profile. The server's map came from the
 * `MAP` environment variable. Nothing reconciled them.
 *
 * `Welcome` has carried `mapId` and `modeId` since the protocol was written. `NetClient`
 * decoded both and stored them in two public fields, and **nothing in the client ever read
 * either one.** So the two halves quietly disagreed, and the symptoms all pointed somewhere
 * else:
 *
 * - The player spawned at coordinates chosen by the server against *its* map, which on the
 *   client's map is somewhere outside the geometry.
 * - Movement predicted against the client's colliders and was corrected against the server's,
 *   so every step produced a misprediction and a rubber-band.
 * - Walls the client could see were not in the server's world, so the player walked through
 *   them — and walls the server had were invisible.
 *
 * Every one of those reads as a netcode failure. None of them is. The netcode was doing
 * exactly what it was told with two different worlds.
 *
 * ## Why the handshake had to move out of `NetClient`
 *
 * The dependency runs in a circle: prediction needs a `PlayerController`, which needs the
 * map's `CollisionWorld`, which needs to know *which map* — which only the server can say,
 * over a connection that `NetClient` owns. Cutting it means doing the handshake on a bare
 * link first, with nothing built yet, and handing the open link and the answer to a
 * `NetClient` afterwards via `NetClient.adopt`.
 *
 * The protocol is unchanged: one `Hello` out, one `Welcome` back. This is the same exchange
 * happening thirty lines earlier.
