/**
 * Grenades and equipment (brief S6.3).
 *
 * `equipment/` is a directory S3's layout does not name. The alternative was `weapons/`,
 * which is already the largest package in the project and whose contents are all "a thing
 * you shoot"; a frag is a thrown, fused, bouncing volume that damages by radius and blinds
 * by angle, and it shares exactly one thing with a rifle — the damage door.
 *
 * That one shared thing is deliberate: **an explosion is a `WeaponDef`.** Every piece of
 * equipment below carries a `damageProfile` shaped like a weapon, so radial damage goes
 * through `DamageSystem.apply` unchanged and the number a grenade does to you is computed
 * by the same code as the number a rifle does. M3's rule — "damage has exactly one door" —
 * survives, and the debug read-out prints a grenade the same way it prints a bullet.
 *
 * `projectileSpeed` on the profile is the legitimate use S4.4 carves out: thrown equipment
 * is the *only* thing in this project that is not hitscan.
