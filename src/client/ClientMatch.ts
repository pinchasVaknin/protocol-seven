/**
 * Composition root for the MATCH state.
 *
 * `Game.ts` is the state machine; this is everything a match is made of, in one place, so
 * that neither file drifts past the size the architecture allows. It owns the wiring — and
 * wiring is all it does. Every connection here is an EventBus subscription, because S3 says
 * systems must not reach into each other, and the systems that fire, resolve and present a
 * shot genuinely do not know about one another:
 *
 *   WeaponSystem --weapon.fired--> flash, tracer, gunshot, camera shake, latency probe
 *   Ballistics   --bullet.impact-> debris, decal, impact report
 *   DamageSystem --damage.dealt--> hitmarker, hit audio, damage numbers, target read-out
 *   MatchFlow    --killfeed/score/announcer--> the HUD
 *
 * That is also what lets the headless harness run a full match with no renderer, no audio
 * context and no DOM: nothing downstream of the sim is required for the sim to run.
 *
 * M4 added the mode above it. `ScoreSystem`, the `GameMode` and `MatchFlow` are constructed
 * here and the flow's respawn gate is handed to both the bot director and the player's own
 * respawn timer, so "nobody comes back once the match is over" is one rule.
