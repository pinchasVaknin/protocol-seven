/**
 * Turns the authoritative `EventBus` into the replicated event stream (M10, S4.15).
 *
 * S4.15 draws the line this class implements: *"Cosmetics are driven by replicated events,
 * not by replicated state. The server says `damage.dealt`; the client decides what that looks
 * and sounds like."*
 *
 * So the server sends **what happened**, and never what it looked like. A `Fired` goes out;
 * the muzzle flash, the tracer, the shell ejection, the camera shake and the impact decal do
 * not, because every one of them is a decision the client makes about how to draw an event it
 * has been told about. S3 puts the same thing another way — *"A networked event and a local
 * one must be indistinguishable to the client"* — and that is exactly what makes this work:
 * the client already has code that turns `weapon.fired` into a flash and a bang, and it does
 * not care whether the bus entry came from its own weapon or from a socket.
 *
 * ## Why bullet impacts are not on the wire
 *
 * They were the obvious candidate and they are deliberately absent. `Fired` carries the
 * round's terminus and the material it stopped in, which is everything the client needs to
 * draw the tracer, the spark and the decal itself. Replicating a separate impact per pellet
 * would put eight events on the wire for one shotgun blast to produce marks nobody is looking
 * at. The one approximation this accepts: a shotgun's spread is drawn from the first pellet's
 * terminus, so the pattern on a wall is synthesised rather than exact.
