/**
 * What a match pays for having been played (playtest round 5, B6).
 *
 * The report was a whole match — 0 kills, 6 deaths, a loss — awarding `+0 XP`, with the panel
 * under the bar rendering as an empty box and the menu behind it still saying "500 XP TO NEXT"
 * with the bar on zero. Every row in `XP_SOURCES` was contingent on succeeding; there was no row
 * for showing up, so `buildLines` skipped all ten and returned nothing at all.
 *
 * This drives the real `MatchProgression` — sampled by the real `WeaponSystem` and
 * `PlayerController` it is sampled by in a match, against a real `ScoreSystem` — for a stated
 * number of ticks, then closes it out the way `MatchMeta.finish` does. Every row carries the two
 * things B6 is about: what the match paid, and how many lines the summary would have to draw.
 *
 * ## The three cases, and what each is for
 *
 * - **worst** — the report's own match: nothing scored, a loss, six minutes. Must pay more than
 *   zero and must produce at least one line. This is the case that was broken.
 * - **short** — thirty seconds of the same. Must still pay the flat award and must **not** carry
 *   a time row, because `matchMinutes` floors: a match under a minute has no whole minutes in it,
 *   and rounding up would be a number a player could farm by joining and leaving.
 * - **played** — ten minutes of the same nothing. Must pay strictly more than **worst**, which is
 *   the whole content of *"a long match pays more than a short one"*.
 *
 * ## Why the warmup arena is not a case here
 *
 * B6 asks that time in the waiting room must not pay, and the honest way to state that is that
 * there is no path for it to pay along, rather than a zero this file could assert. A summary is
 * built by `LiveMatch.buildSummary`; `WarmupMatch` has no such method. On the client,
 * `Game.applyRotation` calls `teardownWorld` before building the live world, so the live match
 * gets a `MatchProgression` constructed at zero rather than one carrying the room's minutes.
 * Asserting a zero against a call that cannot happen is a green light with no bulb behind it —
 * see PLAN.md's standing lesson about unreachable guards. `npm run skirmish` reports the room's
 * own numbers, which is where that claim is checked.
 *
 * Pure: a throwaway world, bus, score, tracker and store per row, no clock, no wire, no DOM, and
 * nobody fires. One run is a fact rather than a sample, which is what puts it beside
 * `auditAccuracy` and `auditReplicatedScore` at the top of a harness run.
 *
 * ## The second half: one fight, two ledgers (M13 Phase B, bug 4.2)
 *
 * A dedicated server now keeps a `MatchLedger` per seat and pays what it counted, where it used
 * to pay a flat list to everybody. The claim that makes that safe is that the ledger is the
 * *same counting* single-player has done since M6 — and a claim about two runtimes agreeing is
 * exactly the kind this project has learned to measure rather than argue. So `playFight` runs
 * one scripted fight — a longshot headshot, a damaged victim somebody else finishes, a death —
 * through a solo `MatchProgression` keyed to entity 0 and through a server-shaped `MatchLedger`
 * keyed to entity 7, and asserts every row the server can price comes out identical: same
 * source, same count, same XP. The two rows only a save can price — challenges and weapon
 * levels — are excluded by name, and the exclusion is printed.
