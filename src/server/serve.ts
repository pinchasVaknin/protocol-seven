/**
 * The dedicated server's entry point (M10, S4.9 and S6.6).
 *
 * Separate from `main.ts`, which is the M9 headless *harness* — that one runs matches as fast
 * as it can and exits with a result. This one listens, and does not stop. They share every
 * line of simulation and nothing else, and conflating them would mean a flag deciding whether
 * the process is a long-lived service or a batch job.
 *
 * ```bash
 *   PORT=8080 npm run serve
 * ```
 *
 * Everything else comes from the environment (`Config.ts`), because S4.9 requires the address
 * to be injected rather than hardcoded and there is no reason for the port, the map or the
 * tick rate to be different in that respect.
