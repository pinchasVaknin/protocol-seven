/**
 * Challenges (brief S6.5): thirty of them, every one driven off the EventBus.
 *
 * S6.5 defines the shape and this file honours it literally — **"a challenge is a
 * subscription plus a counter plus a completion rule"**. The subscription is
 * `ChallengeTracker`'s, which subscribes *once* per event kind rather than once per
 * challenge; the counter is a number in the save; and the completion rule is the `rule`
 * field below. Nothing polls anything.
 *
 * The rules are predicates over a *fact*, not over raw event payloads. `KillFact` is
 * assembled at the moment of a kill from things that live in four different systems —
 * the weapon, the player's stance, the damage that landed and the score — because
 * "kills after sliding" is a question none of those four can answer alone. Building the
 * fact once and testing thirty cheap predicates against it is both faster and far easier
 * to read than thirty subscriptions each reaching for their own context.
 *
 * Camo challenges are the exception and are absolute rather than incremental: their progress
 * is the *best* any single weapon has reached, and the challenge — with its XP — is a career
 * milestone that lands once. "25 kills with a single weapon" is therefore the honest phrasing,
 * and it is what the challenge list prints.
 *
 * **The camo it pays out, though, belongs to the weapon that earned it** (playtest,
 * 2026-09-23). Until then a camo was an account-wide boolean, so 25 kills with the carbine
 * put DIGITAL on every gun in the game — which makes the reward a one-time tax rather than
 * something you do *with a weapon*. `camosEarnedBy` below is the whole rule, read off the same
 * rows the challenges are: it takes one weapon's own counters and answers which camos that
 * weapon has earned. The tracker grants from it, the save migration recomputes from it, and
 * nothing else decides what a camo costs.
