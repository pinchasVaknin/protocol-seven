/**
 * What every HUD surface's visibility is derived from (M11 Gate B, playtest round 4).
 *
 * ## The invariant this file exists to make checkable
 *
 * *Every HUD surface has exactly one writer, and its visibility is a pure function of state
 * that outlives the surface, evaluated once per frame from one place.*
 *
 * Three reports in round four were the same defect wearing different hats, and the shape was
 * always one of two things: a surface whose "am I open" was stored in **two** places and only
 * one of them was written (the debug overlay's ×), or a surface written from a code path that
 * **stops running** at the moment the answer needed to change (the scoreboard, driven from the
 * sim tick, which does not tick while paused). Round three had already established half the
 * rule — *a hidden surface never consumes a key* — and this is the other half: a surface that
 * has stopped being shown must release what it latched, and the cheapest way to guarantee that
 * is for it never to have latched anything in the first place.
 *
 * ## Why these live in `shared/`
 *
 * They are the half that can be wrong invisibly. `HeadlessClient` builds no `ClientMatch` and
 * has no DOM, so a claim about a panel is a browser claim — but a claim about the *rule* is an
 * ordinary function with an ordinary answer, and the harness can run it over a real connection
 * across death, respawn, round end and migration. That is the same reasoning that put
 * `pickSpectatorTarget` in `shared/modes/SpectatorTarget.ts`, and it caught 292 selections'
 * worth of invariant there.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the DOM, so `shared/` compiles without the DOM lib exactly as it did
 * before. See `scripts/check-boundaries.mjs`.
 *
 * ## `editorOpen` is gone (round 4, B8)
 *
 * Both predicates below used to test it: Create-a-Class could be open as an overlay over a
 * live match, and a surface behind a full-screen editor is a surface that must be down. Round
 * four's loadout doctrine removed that route — the editor is a front-end screen and
 * `LEGAL_TRANSITIONS` no longer admits `MATCH -> LOADOUT` — so the flag could only ever be
 * false wherever these are evaluated. A condition that cannot fire is a rule guarding nothing,
 * and leaving one in a table whose whole purpose is to say what each surface is derived from
 * is how the table stops describing the code.
 */

/**
 * Where the player last asked for the debug overlay. **One value, not two booleans.**
 *
 * The B1 report — *"the × closes it, but coming back to the game reopens it"* — is what two
 * booleans cost. `Game` held "was it open when we paused" beside `DebugOverlay`'s own
 * `visible`, the × wrote only the second, and the resume restored an intent the player had
 * already cancelled.
 *
 * A single tri-state carries everything the two booleans were trying to say, and it says it
 * about the **request** rather than about the surface — so it survives the world being torn
 * down and rebuilt underneath it, which a flag on the overlay cannot:
 *
 * - `'none'` — not wanted. The only thing the × and Escape ever write.
 * - `'inMatch'` — wanted, asked for from the game. Hidden for the duration of a pause and put
 *   back on resume, which is M5's rule: the overlay is a large interactive panel and the pause
 *   screen is modal, and two of those stacked is the UI clash the pause menu was reported for.
 * - `'onPause'` — wanted, asked for **from the pause screen**. Visible over it, because the
 *   tuning sliders need a cursor and paused is the only time there is one. It demotes to
 *   `'inMatch'` on resume, which is how *"once the overlay has been opened on purpose it stays
 *   open through the resume"* is kept without a second flag remembering it.

/**
 * The mode brief, under the caption, and only in the window it can be read in (round 4, F10).
 *
 * ## Which window, and why it is that one
 *
 * The **pre-match freeze of round one** — `MatchFlowDeps.matchStartSeconds`, the intro's
 * length plus the countdown since M17 C2; ten seconds flat before that, which round two had
 * lengthened from three for the quick class selector. It is the only moment in a
 * match when a player is standing still, cannot be shot, and has not yet decided anything. The
 * later rounds of a Search & Destroy series get three seconds and no brief: by round two the
 * player has played round one, and a banner over the crosshair at the moment a one-life round
 * starts is a banner in front of an angle somebody is holding.
 *
 * The window is deliberately the *same expression* as `quickLoadoutWindow`'s `'prematch'` arm —
 * `WARMUP`, round one — because they are the same window. Two rules that must agree and are
 * written twice are two rules that will eventually disagree; if that arm ever changes, this
 * reads the change.
 *
 * ## The three surfaces in that window, and how they do not collide
 *
 * P10 asked for the priority between them to be defined rather than discovered. It is defined
 * by **derivation and geometry, not by z-order**, which is what the round-4 invariant is for:
 *
 *  - **The quick class selector** (`.ql`) is a left-edge panel, vertically centred. The brief is
 *    a centred line under the caption at 34% of the height. They share the window and share no
 *    pixels, which is the point — the player is being asked to choose a class *and* told what
 *    the match is for, and those are not competing messages.
 *  - **The ballot** (`.op-vote`) cannot be up here at all, and that is a fact rather than a
 *    z-index. The vote overlay belongs to the arena: the server broadcasts it to `warmup.sessions`
 *    only, and round three made `onMigrated` hide it. A client in a live match's pre-match freeze
 *    has been migrated by definition. The brief is off in the arena for the same structural
 *    reason, from the other side — so the two surfaces are in different instances and no ordering
 *    between them is needed or possible.
 *  - **The objective banner** (`.hud-objective`) sits at 84px, under the score banner, and the
 *    alive strip at 52px. Both are above the brief and neither moves.
 *
 * ## Why the arena is excluded
 *
 * `matchCaption` already ranks the room above the phase and reads `WAITING` there for as long
 * as a player stands in it. There is nothing to brief: §6.3's room has no objective, no score
 * and nothing to win, and F7 took the last of the consequences out of it. A permanent banner
 * over the crosshair of a room nobody is trying to win is exactly the *"present and empty"*
 * element `HudStreaks` refuses to be.
