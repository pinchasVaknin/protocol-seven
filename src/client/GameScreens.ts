/**
 * The front end: every full-screen DOM surface that is not the HUD (M7).
 *
 * Five screens with one lifetime — the main menu, Create-a-Class, the pause screen, the
 * post-match board and the XP animation inside it — all built at boot and kept for the life
 * of the page, because unlike the world they are cheap and hold nothing between matches.
 *
 * They were constructed inline in `Game`'s constructor, which put eighty lines of DOM wiring
 * in the middle of a file whose subject is the state machine, with the summary screen's
 * presentation logic inside a state handler. Pulling them out draws the line where it
 * belongs: **the screens raise intents, `Game` decides what state to go to.** Nothing here
 * calls `transitionTo` — every button is a callback the state machine supplies, which is what
 * keeps the legal-transition table the only description of how the application moves.
 *
 * The one piece of logic that stayed is the Continue button's: a player who has already seen
 * their XP total does not need to watch the bar arrive at it, so the first press finishes the
 * animation and only the second leaves. That is a property of the two screens involved and
 * belongs with them.
