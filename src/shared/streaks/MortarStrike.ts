 * Mortar Strike (brief S6.1): the player marks a zone, delayed shells land in sequence.
 *
 * The targeting overlay is `ui/MortarOverlay.ts` and is drawn from `MapDef` through the same
 * renderer the minimap uses, exactly as the brief asks. This class starts *after* the mark is
 * confirmed and knows nothing about how it was chosen — which is what lets a bot call one in
 * later with no UI at all.
 *
 * ## The sequence is the point
 *
 * Twelve shells at `mortarInterval` apart, scattered around the mark, is a *zone denial* over
 * six seconds rather than a single instant kill. That is the difference between "a mortar
 * landed on me" (unfair) and "a mortar is landing over there, move" (a decision). The delay
 * before the first shell exists for the same reason: the whistle is the warning, and a strike
 * with no warning is just damage.
 *
 * Damage goes through `DamageSystem.apply` like everything else, so mortar kills feed the
 * killfeed, the score, the challenge tracker and the streak counter with no new wiring — and
 * the brief's "the player body is out of play but **not invulnerable to a lucky mortar**" is
 * true for free, because a chopper gunner's body is still a registered damageable standing
 * where it was left.
