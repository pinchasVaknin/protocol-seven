   * did not, and every wall "snagged" — because after arriving the player spent four hundred
   * ticks pressed into the far corner at zero speed. The finding was in the harness.
   *
   * Two kinds of run:
   *   - **wall**: hugged from both sides in turn, so which side the wall is on never has to
   *     be authored and cannot be authored wrong.
   *   - **traverse**: ramps, stairs, the bridge and the catwalk runs, driven straight with no
   *     hug, and additionally asserted to *arrive at the expected height* — which is the real
