 * animation was a side effect of the simulation and could not run without a renderer.
 *

 * snapshot and nothing to send. The renderer keeps its own copy of the serials, compares
 * them each frame, and starts an animation when one has moved. A missed frame cannot lose
 * an event — the serial is still different — which a callback would not have guaranteed.
