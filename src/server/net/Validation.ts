/**
 * Boundary validation on everything a client sends (M10, S4.16).
 *
 * S4.16 sets the scope precisely, and both halves matter:
 *
 * > *"Validate at the boundary: clamp `moveX`/`moveZ` magnitude, reject impossible yaw
 * > deltas, rate-limit fire against the weapon's RPM, reject commands too far from the
 * > current tick."*
 *
 * > *"Do not build heuristic anti-cheat — no speed-hack detectors, no aim analysis.
 * > Authority plus boundary validation is the whole defence at this scale."*
 *
 * The line between the two is what this file is built on: everything here rejects input that
 * is **structurally impossible**, never input that is merely suspicious. A command with
 * `moveX = 1e9` is not a player, and clamping it costs nothing. A player who lands a lot of
 * headshots is a player who lands a lot of headshots.
 *
 * ## On rate-limiting fire
 *
 * S4.16 names it, and it is worth stating why the implementation is not where a reader would
 * look for it. Rate of fire is enforced by the **server's own `WeaponSystem`**: it steps the
 * authoritative weapon, which produces `pendingShots` from the def's RPM and refuses to
 * produce more. A client that sets the fire bit on every tick of every command gets exactly
 * the weapon's rate of fire, because the server is the thing deciding. That is authority, and
 * it is strictly stronger than a boundary check could be — a check here could only compare
 * against the same number the simulation already enforces.
 *
 * What genuinely needs bounding at the boundary is **how many commands arrive**, since that
 * is bandwidth and CPU rather than gameplay, and that is `rateLimit` below.
 */

/**
 * ## On "reject impossible yaw deltas"
 *
 * S4.16 asks for this by name and it turns out **not to be expressible** for this input
 * model, which is worth recording rather than pretending otherwise.
 *
 * `InputCommand.yaw` is an *absolute* angle (S4.2), and angles wrap. The shortest angular
 * distance between any two absolute yaws is at most pi by construction — so after the
 * wrap-aware comparison every possible pair of consecutive commands is within half a turn,
 * and no threshold at or below pi can ever reject anything. A threshold *below* pi would be
 * an aim-speed limit, which is precisely the heuristic anti-cheat the same section forbids
 * two bullets later: a 180-degree flick in one tick is a thing real players do.
 *
 * The check was implemented, measured to be unreachable, and removed. What remains is a
 * range check that rejects values which are not angles at all (non-finite, or outside
 * +/-2pi), which is the part that was ever doing work. Flagged in the milestone report as an
 * under-specified item in the brief.
 *
 * ## Why a command or a frame was refused
 *
 * Reported per reason by the server metrics (S7).
