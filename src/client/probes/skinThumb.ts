/**
 * The skin thumbnail page (M15, B5): one skin on the Create-a-Class stage, held at one pose,
 * read back as a PNG by `scripts/skin-thumbs.mjs`.
 *
 * The strip under the stage shows every skin at once, and seven live models would be seven
 * renderers and the whole 17 MB library fetched to open a menu. So the thumbnails are made
 * here, once, by the same `CharacterStage` the editor draws the operator with — same lights,
 * same disc, same lens — and committed as `public/models/bots/skins/thumbs/<File>.png`.
 * `check:skins` refuses a skin without one.
 *
 * `?skin=<id>` picks the skin. `window.__skinThumb.render()` resolves to the data URL once
 * the body has arrived and been drawn; it ticks the stage by hand because nothing in a page
 * a script is driving needs a frame loop, and it holds the turntable at a three-quarter
 * view so the seven thumbnails are seven of one picture.
