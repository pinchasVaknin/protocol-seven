/**
 * One running world, and everything the process needs to talk to it (M11, §4.18).
 *
 * M10's `GameServer` was a match, a loop, a socket listener and a rotation policy in one
 * class. This is the match half, lifted out so that two of them can exist: the permanent
 * warmup arena and, when a vote resolves, one live match.
 *
 * ## What an instance owns, and what it does not
 *
 * **Owns**: a `ServerMatch` (the authoritative simulation), a per-client `SnapshotEncoder`, a
 * clock, its own lifecycle state, and the set of sessions seated in it. All of this is
 * per-instance and none of it is shared — §4.19: *"A single shared mutable object between two
 * matches is a correctness failure that will present as an unreproducible desync."*
 *
 * **Does not own**: the loop, the sockets, the routing decision, or the map bake. It is
 * stepped by the master loop, it is handed sessions by `Migration`, and its world geometry is
 * baked once at boot and shared read-only.
 *
 * ## The step is wrapped by the caller, not here
 *
 * §4.18: *"An exception inside one instance must not take down the process."* The wrapping
 * lives in `Server.tick` rather than in `step()`, because the two subclasses need different
 * recoveries — a `LiveMatch` migrates its players out and is destroyed, a `WarmupMatch` must
 * be rebuilt in place because there is nowhere to migrate anyone *to*. A base class that
 * swallowed its own exceptions would have to guess which.

   * four parts are private and one of them is the whole value of a killstreak.
   *
   * ## The two filters, and why they are different
   *
   * **Bodies are common.** A sentry and a care package are physical objects that both teams can
   * see, walk into and shoot. The entity list is built once and every seat gets the same one.
   *
   * **Intel is not.** A UAV's contacts go only to the team whose UAV recorded them. Broadcasting
   * them and trusting the client to ignore the other team's would put a UAV's entire value in
   * the untrusted half of the system (§4.16) — and "trust the client to not look" is precisely
   * the shape of bug a wallhack is.
   *
   * **Ghost is inside the intel filter, not beside it.** `Uav.onTick` already declines to record
   * a contact for anyone whose `visibleToUav` is false, so a Ghost player never enters this list
   * in the first place. Note what is *not* happening: their entity stays in `buildEntities` and
   * their body is drawn normally. Ghost hides you from UAV intel; it does not make you invisible,
   * and an entity filter — the obvious reading of §8.22's *"absent from the snapshot"* — would
   * ship a different perk from the one M6 designed.
