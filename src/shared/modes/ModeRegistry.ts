 * the six are getters that assemble the sentence from the map's authored objectives, so

 * expression over the source can answer it. `scripts/check-unlocks.mjs` says the same thing
 * about its own limits from the other side.
 *
 * Each mode is constructed against **the first map it can legally run on** — the same
 * `modesForMap` filter the menu uses — because Search & Destroy throws on a map with no bomb
 * sites and Domination on one with no flags, and a mode that cannot be built anywhere is a
 * different fault which this reports as such rather than crashing on.
