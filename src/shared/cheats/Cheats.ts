/**
 * Cheat codes, and the entitlements they grant (M11 Gate B, playtest round 4, F14).
 *
 * ## A code is input; an entitlement is state
 *
 * That sentence is the whole of this file and the reason it exists at all. The report asks for
 * six codes, and the naive build is six booleans written by six keypress handlers — at which
 * point every effect has to ask *"was the code typed"*, the server has no way to be the source
 * of truth about any of it, and turning the whole thing off is six edits.
 *
 * So the code is parsed **once**, into a mask of entitlements, and every effect downstream reads
 * the mask and nothing else. `check-cheats.mjs` enforces the half of that a human would forget:
 * no code string appears anywhere outside this file.
 *
 * ## Two authorities, one store, and the partition is the security argument
 *
 * `SPEC[]1` to `SPEC[]4` change what the **simulation** says: whether a round hurts you, whether
 * a bot comes looking, whether a wall stops you. Against a dedicated server a client granting
 * itself those is not a cheat code, it is an exploit — it either does nothing (the server keeps
 * killing you) or it works, and then it is a hole. So those bits are `CHEAT_SIMULATION`, and the
 * **server is their only author**; a client's copy is replicated state it reads and never writes.
 *
 * `DEBUG666` changes a client surface and nothing else, so the client authors it — and it grants
 * **no entitlement at all**. It is `kind: 'surface'`, it never reaches the wire, and there is no
 * bit anywhere in this file for it. Gating it behind the server flag would make the debug overlay
 * unreachable in single-player, where there is no server, and unreachable against a deployed one
 * — which is exactly where every "needs a browser" list in PLAN.md sends somebody to read the
 * NetPanel.
 *
 * So **every bit in the table below is server-authored**, without exception, and `Game.cheatMask`
 * is one mask from one authority rather than a merge of two halves. `check-cheats.mjs` enforces
 * the property that makes that true: a `'surface'` code may not carry entitlement bits.
 *
 * F14 gave `DEBUG666` a bit, and the bit was a second copy of `debugRequest` — which round four's
 * B1 had already established as *the* single store for "is the overlay wanted", after a defect
 * whose description was *"two copies of 'is the debug overlay open', and the × wrote one of
 * them"*. The × wrote one of them again: it cleared the request and left the bit, so typing the
 * code after closing the panel read as *"off"* and a third press was needed to reopen. Deleting
 * the bit is the fix, and it is B1's fix a second time.
 *
 * ## Every entitlement's lifetime, and where it is cleared
 *
 * F14 shipped without this table and the omission was the whole of the regression that followed:
 * the store was put on the `Session`, which outlives a seat, and every entitlement in it was
 * therefore granted for longer than the thing it was granted against. A cheat typed in the arena
 * followed the player into the live match; the receipt for a wallet payment outlived the wallet.
 *
 * | Entitlement | Kind | Lifetime | Cleared, server | Cleared, client |
 * |---|---|---|---|---|
 * | `DEBUG666` | surface | **the session** — the tab | never sent | it *is* `debugRequest`; the ×, Escape and the code all write that one value. Deliberately survives a migration and a rotation |
 * | `Cheat.God` | toggle | **the seat** — one instance | `MatchInstance.unseat` | `NetClient.onWelcome`'s S4.18 discard |
 * | `Cheat.Unseen` | toggle | the seat | same | same |
 * | `Cheat.NoClip` | toggle | the seat | same | same |
 * | the wallet payment | **instant** | the payment is over the moment it lands; what it pays *into* belongs to a life (`StreakLedger.resetLife`) | nothing to clear — no bit is kept | the caption expires after `CHEAT_NOTICE_SECONDS`, and `onMigrated` drops it |
 *
 * **The seat, not the connection, is the unit.** A migration destroys the entity, the scoreboard
 * seat's streak ledger row (`removePlayer` runs `StreakSystem.onOwnerRemoved`, which is `onDeath`
 * plus `ledger.forget`) and the encoder — so an entitlement that survived it was an entitlement
 * against an entity that no longer existed. It is also the *silent* case rather than the loud one:
 * god mode in the arena does nothing at all, because F7 already spares every combatant in that
 * room, so the only place it means anything is a live match — and carrying it in from a room where
 * it was a no-op is exactly how nobody notices.
 *
 * ## Why `shared/`
 *
 * The same reason `HudSurfaces` and `pickSpectatorTarget` are here: the server parses codes and
 * the client parses codes, and two spellings of "SPEC[]4 means all three" is two places to get
 * it wrong. Nothing here touches the DOM.
 */

/**
 * One entitlement per bit. The mask crosses the wire as a single byte.
 *
 * **Every bit here is a state a player can be *in*, and every one of them is the server's.**
 * Two bits have been removed since F14 and both for the same reason — they were not states:
 *
 * - `Wallet` was a receipt for a transaction, and it outlived the ledger row it described.
 * - `Debug` was a second copy of `debugRequest`, and only one of the two was written when the
 *   panel was dismissed.
 *
 * The bits that remain are the three the simulation reads. If a candidate bit has no line in
 * `Perception`, `DamageSystem` or `PlayerController` that reads it, it is not one of these.

/**
 * What a recognised code asks for. `kind` is the discriminant and there is no second flag
 * beside it; the three kinds are three *lifetimes*:
 *
 * - `'toggle'` — a state a player is in until they leave it. It has an entitlement bit, the
 *   server owns it, it is replicated, and the HUD shows it for as long as it is true.
 * - `'instant'` — a transaction, over the moment it lands. No bit, nothing replicated, and the
 *   HUD *announces* it for a display duration.
 * - `'surface'` — a client surface with no simulation behind it. No bit, never sent to the
 *   server, and the store it writes is the one that already owns that surface.
 * - `'unlock'` — a grant against the player's own **save**, which is the client's file and
 *   nobody else's. No bit, never sent, and it writes through `Profile` like every other
 *   progression write, so the unlock audit's rules and the loadout sanitiser see it the way
 *   they see a kill threshold that has been met. Its lifetime is the save's: it is a
 *   progression grant and it does not expire, which is what makes it useful for a test class
 *   that has to survive a reload.
 *
 *   What it grants widened on 2026-09-24 (the human's brief §3), from every attachment to
 *   the whole arsenal: every weapon permanently unlocked, every weapon at the top of its own
 *   level ladder, every attachment that fits it, and every camo on every weapon. One thing
 *   it deliberately does **not** touch is the account level — see `Game.requestCheat`, where
 *   the grant lives. The XP economy is what the summary screen, the level flourish and the
 *   whole unlock ladder are read off, and a cheat that forges it makes every one of them
 *   lie; `permanentUnlocks` is the override that already exists for saying *this player may
 *   have this* without claiming they earned the level for it.
 *
 * F14 carried a `local` boolean as well, which meant the same thing as `'surface'` does and could
 * disagree with the bits; `check-cheats.mjs` now enforces the invariant that made that flag
 * redundant — a `'surface'` code carries no entitlement bits, so a client can never author one.
 *
 * A toggle carries the bits it flips. An instant carries its payload — today only `kills`, and a
 * second kind of payment would add a field here rather than a branch anywhere downstream. A
 * surface carries nothing: which surface is the client's business, and there is exactly one.

 * exactly what `DebugSuite.dispose` was doing through `Spectator.reset()`: a player holding god
 * mode alone was migrated, the teardown asked to toggle all three, the request landed on a mask
 * the migration had already cleared to zero — and arrived in the next match with **everything**
 * on. One kill and a mask of 2 became a mask of 14.
