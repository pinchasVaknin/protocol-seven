/**
 * The objectives, as things you can see in the world (M7, brief S6.3).
 *
 * The brief asks for "objective capture progress rings, flag ownership indicators, dog tag
 * markers, bomb site indicators". Every one of those is a *world* object rather than a HUD
 * element, and that is a deliberate reading: a capture ring drawn on the HUD tells you a
 * number, and a capture ring drawn on the floor tells you **where to stand**. Domination is
 * decided by standing in the right circle, so the circle belongs on the ground.
 *
 * ## The one exception, and its exact boundary (playtest round 4, F2)
 *
 * *"A marker arrow pointing at the bomb to pick up."* An arrow on the HUD is a departure from
 * the rule above and it is worth being precise about why it is allowed here and nowhere else.
 *
 * The rule's argument is that a world marker answers *where do I stand* and a HUD marker only
 * answers *which way is it*. For a capture ring that is decisive. For a bomb lying somewhere in
 * a 60-metre map that the round cannot start without, *which way is it* is the entire question,
 * and the world object answering it is a 0.3 m box behind a container. The mode's own history
 * says the same thing from the other end: this file already carries the note that a carried
 * bomb was invisible and the mode was reported as having *"no bomb"*.
 *
 * So the exception is **the loose bomb only**, and that boundary is what keeps it honest rather
 * than being a wallhack with a justification:
 *
 *  - `bomb === 'CARRIED' && carrierId === -1` — on the floor, claimable, a fixed point in the
 *    world that both sides can already see blinking. The arrow adds a bearing to a fact that is
 *    public.
 *  - `carrierId >= 0` — **no arrow**. The bomb's position is a living player's position, and an
 *    indicator that tracks it through geometry is a legitimised wallhack on whoever picked it
 *    up. `followCarrier` makes `bombX/Y/Z` true every tick precisely so the mesh can ride its
 *    carrier, and that is exactly what makes the HUD version dangerous.
 *  - `PLANTED` — no arrow. The site is a world object with a ring and an accelerating light,
 *    and by then everybody knows where it is.
 *
 * That falls out of `readBombBearing` rather than out of a check somewhere else, so the intel
 * filter is satisfied by construction: there is no code path that can hand the HUD a carried
 * bomb's coordinates.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * Everything here is built once at construction and only ever *transformed* or recoloured
 * afterwards. Three flags is three poles, three banners and three rings — nine meshes with
 * shared geometry, updated by writing a scale and a colour. Dog tags come from a pool sized
 * to the roster, because a tag is dropped and collected several times a minute and allocating
 * a mesh per death is the kind of thing that shows up as a sawtooth in the heap harness.
 *
 * ## Why it reads the mode directly
 *
 * `MatchFeedback` and `MatchEquipment` are event-driven because what they present is
 * *momentary* — a hit, a flash, an explosion. Objective state is continuous: a flag is 40%
 * captured for a second and a half, and reconstructing that from events would mean mirroring
 * the mode's state machine here and keeping the two in step. So this asks the mode what is
 * true each frame, which is one source of truth rather than two.
