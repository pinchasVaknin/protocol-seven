/**
 * The F14 cheat audit, as a check that can fail (M11 Gate B, playtest round 4).
 *
 * F14's design is one sentence — *a code is input, an entitlement is state, and every effect
 * reads the entitlement* — and the two ways that sentence stops being true are both silent.
 *
 * ## 1. An effect that asks whether a code was typed
 *
 * The failure that actually happens is not a second entitlement store; it is one `if
 * (code === 'SPEC[]1')` written in a hurry somewhere downstream, at which point the server has
 * stopped being the source of truth about that effect and nobody can tell by reading the
 * entitlement. So a code string may appear in exactly two places: the table that defines it, and
 * the harness that types one to test it. Anywhere else fails.
 *
 * ## 2. A client-authored entitlement
 *
 * Every bit in the table is the server's. A `'surface'` code — one the client applies to itself
 * without asking — must therefore carry no bits at all, and a bit outside `CHEAT_SIMULATION`
 * could never be granted by anybody. Both are silent failures: the first is an exploit, the
 * second is a code that does nothing.
 *
 * ## What this file deliberately does *not* check
 *
 * The arithmetic. `bitsClearing` clearing every mask to exactly zero is the property the shipped
 * regression violated, and it was written here first — as a re-implementation of the function in
 * JavaScript, because this script cannot import TypeScript. Watched red, it **stayed green** with
 * the real function broken, because it was proving a property of its own copy.
 *
 * That is the trap this milestone keeps meeting from a new direction, so the proof moved to where
 * the real function runs: `assertClearingArithmetic` in `skirmishHarness.ts`, which imports it and
 * folds `toggleCheat` over its answer for every reachable mask on **every** harness run. A check
 * that cannot fail is worse than no check, because it is trusted.
 *
 * Same mechanism as `check-cosmetics` and `check-unlocks`: a rule a human has to remember is a
 * rule that will be broken by the next milestone.
