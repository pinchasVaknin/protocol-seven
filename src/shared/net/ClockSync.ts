/**
 * Which tick the client should be simulating (M10, S4.11).
 *
 * ## The rule this file exists to enforce
 *
 * S4.11: *"The server tick is the clock. Clients derive their tick number from a synced
 * server clock and **never** increment it locally."*
 *
 * The reason is S4.1's discard rule. A client that counted its own ticks would, on any frame
 * long enough to owe more than five steps, throw the backlog away — and its tick number would
 * fall permanently behind the server's, with nothing reporting it. Every command it sent from
 * then on would be stamped for a tick the server had already simulated. Deriving the number
 * from a clock instead means a stalled frame costs a hitch and nothing more: the tick number
 * catches up by itself because it was never being counted in the first place.
 *
 * ## Running ahead
 *
 * S4.11 again: *"Clients run ahead of the server by `RTT/2 + jitter buffer` so a command
 * sampled for tick N arrives before the server simulates tick N. Measure and adapt this
 * offset per client; do not hardcode it."*
 *
 * So the target tick is
 *
 * ```
 *   serverTickNow + ceil((RTT/2 + jitterMargin) / tickMs)
 * ```
 *
 * A command that arrives *early* is free — it waits in the input buffer. A command that
 * arrives *late* is not: the server repeats the previous one and the player's input is
 * silently a tick stale. So the lead is deliberately biased to be generous, and the margin is
 * derived from measured jitter rather than guessed.
 *
 * ## Why the offset is a minimum, not an average
 *
 * The clock offset estimate uses the sample with the **lowest RTT** in the recent window
 * rather than the mean. On a jittery link, a delayed packet inflates the apparent offset in
 * one direction only — delay is always positive — so averaging biases the estimate by roughly
 * half the mean delay and the bias grows with jitter. The fastest round trip observed is the
 * one least contaminated by queueing, which is the standard NTP insight and it matters here
 * for the same reason.

 * target suddenly several ticks away is a client that thinks it has stalled. The playtest suspected

   * sample means claiming `rtt = 0`, and that claim is poisonous here in a way it would not be
   * in a mean-based estimator — `recompute` picks the offset belonging to the **lowest-RTT**
   * sample in the window, and a zero always wins. One fabricated sample therefore owned the
   * offset for the whole sixteen-sample window, about four seconds at 4 Hz.
   *
   * The consequence is exactly what the playtest reported. The seeded offset is half a real
   * round trip *too low*, so `targetTick` runs the client behind where it should be, its
   * commands arrive for ticks the server has already simulated, the input buffer starves and
   * repeats, and prediction and simulation pull apart on every tick — heavy rubberbanding at
   * spawn that eases as real samples finally displace it.
   *
   * So the seed sets the offset directly and stays out of the window. The first real ping
   * replaces it outright rather than easing toward it (see `recompute`), because a provisional
   * value is not evidence to be averaged with.
