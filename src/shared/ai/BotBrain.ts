/**
 * The bot's decision layer (brief S6.2).
 *
 * `decide` picks the state, four times a second. `steer` turns whatever state that is
 * into one `InputCommand`, sixty times a second. Nothing else in the project produces bot
 * movement, and the command it writes is the same immutable record the player's input
 * sampler produces — which is what makes S6.1's symmetry structural rather than a claim:
 * a bot is a command source, so `PlayerController` cannot tell the difference and neither
 * can the netcode boundary.
 *
 * The split is deliberate and it is what S6.6 asks for. Deciding *what* to do is the
 * expensive part (cover scoring, path requests, target selection) and it runs at 4 Hz;
 * carrying it out is cheap and runs every tick, so a bot never stutters between decisions.
 *
 * Two things here exist purely so bots do not look broken, and both earn their place:
 * **stuck detection**, because a path that ends up against geometry has to be abandoned
 * rather than leaned into, and **strafe validation** against the navmesh, because a bot
 * that strafes off the pit lip is a bot the player stops taking seriously.

 * corner therefore has a forward component that wobbles by a tenth either side of whatever the
 * corner needs. Tested against a single threshold it dithered: measured over ten TDM matches on
 * FOUNDRY, one edge per travelling bot-second and a mean sprint 0.48 s long, and a bot
 * alternating 6.9 m/s and 4.6 m/s twice a second has not decided anything.
 *
 * The band is 0.17 wide because that is the whole of the problem it can reach. Classifying every
 * sprint ending in one baseline match by its cause: 39% were `moveZ`, 33% were arriving inside
 * the 3.5 m path-distance gate, 24% were the state leaving for ENGAGE or SUPPRESS, and the rest
 * were airborne or mid-climb. Of the `moveZ` ones, 28% sat in [0.55, 0.72) — a genuine wobble —
 * and 44% were at a *negative* `moveZ`, which is a bot walking backwards while it faces the
 * enemy and should not be sprinting at all. So the band covers 11% of all endings, and that is
 * what it buys: measured, 9% fewer edges and a mean sprint 9% longer, with the share of travel
 * spent at sprint speed unmoved. The other 89% are not dither, they are decisions.
 *
 * So entering a sprint still costs a genuinely forward stick, and keeping one only costs more
 * forward than sideways — which is what a human's hand actually does through a corner.
 *
 * `SPRINT_KEEP_MOVE_Z` must stay above `PlayerController`'s own `moveZ > 0.5` sprint gate. Below
 * it the brain would hold the button through a band where the controller refuses it, which is a
 * sprint that is latched rather than running — and, because `Btn.Ads` is suppressed while the
