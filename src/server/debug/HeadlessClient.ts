 * which affect a single number this milestone is measured on.
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * Three things, and they are the reason it was worth building before the browser client:
 *
 * 1. **Verification.** S8's criteria 4, 5, 6, 10 and 12 are all measurements, and a
 *    measurement taken by hand in a browser is a measurement taken once. This takes them
 *    repeatedly and identically.
 * 2. **Soak.** S7 asks for a networked match that can be left running unattended.
 * 3. **Proving the prediction code is runtime-agnostic.** If `NetClient` ever reaches for a
 *    browser API, this stops compiling — which is a better guarantee than a rule.
 *
 * ## The input script
 *
 * Deliberately not a `BotBrain`. A bot's job is to play well; this one's job is to exercise
 * the netcode, which means doing the things that are *hard* to predict and replicate:
 * strafing hard enough that lag compensation matters, jumping, crouching, sprinting into
 * walls, and firing in bursts. It is seeded, so two runs at different simulated latencies are
 * driving the identical input and their numbers are comparable.
