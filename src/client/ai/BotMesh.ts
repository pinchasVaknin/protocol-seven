/**
 * A bot's body, and the way it dies (brief S6.8; playtest round 5, F4).
 *
 * ## The mesh was the rig, and now it is the rig plus an animation
 *
 * Until round 5 this file could say *"the mesh IS the rig: the boxes drawn here are the boxes
 * a round is tested against, so what you can hit is what you can see"*, and that sentence is
 * rewritten rather than left standing, because F4 required breaking it in one direction.
 *
 * **The head and the torso are still exactly the rig.** They are the two boxes a fight is
 * decided by, and nothing here moves them by a millimetre.
 *
 * **The arms and the legs are not, and that is the decision.** The legs swing about their hips
 * and the arms are pitched forward onto the weapon, while `HitboxRig` keeps both boxes upright
 * where it always had them. F4 states the rule plainly — *"if the legs move and the hitbox does
 * not, that is correct"* — and the reason it is correct is that a hitbox that followed a
 * cosmetic animation would be a cosmetic deciding gameplay, which is the §4.15 line. The rig
 * takes yaw and a stance scale and nothing else, deliberately, and that has not changed.
 *
 * The cost is a real one and it is published rather than described: `npm run readability`
 * prints how far each drawn limb gets from its box over a whole gait cycle. It lands on the
 * arm and leg zones, which `HitboxRig`'s own comment calls *"the silhouette edges where a
 * sloppy spray lands"* — the two zones with the lowest multipliers in the game.
 *
 * ## What the report was, and what it turned out to be
 *
 * F4 read *"a torso box and a head. No arms, no legs, no walk cycle, no weapon in the hands."*
 * Two thirds of that was already false in the tree: `HUMANOID_RIG` has had `armL`, `armR`,
 * `legL` and `legR` since M2 and this file has drawn all four since M3 — welded into **one
 * static mesh** with the torso, with the two leg boxes four centimetres apart, which is
 * 1.1 px at twenty metres. Limbs that cannot move and cannot be told apart are limbs nobody
 * sees. They are separate nodes now, and the legs are driven by `shared/ai/Gait.ts`.
 *
 * The weapon was real and was worse than absent: five hand-typed boxes, identical on every
 * bot no matter what `drawBotWeapon` dealt them — the third description of what a rifle looks
 * like, after the one round 4's F15 deleted. It comes from `buildHeldWeaponGeometry` now,
 * through the same `WeaponModelSpec` the viewmodel and the killfeed glyph are built from.
 *
 * The one piece of geometry here that is still not a hitbox and never was is the chest rig and
 * the visor plate, which exist so a silhouette is not a bare stack of boxes and so you can
 * tell at a glance which way a bot is facing.
 *
 * **Ragdoll-lite death.** S6.8 asks for an impulse-driven fall taken from the killing hit,
 * in three or four variants, with no physics library — so it is a scripted fall with
 * damped rotation about the feet. Pivoting at the feet is what makes it work without a
 * solver: a body rotated 90 degrees about its own feet is already lying on the floor, so
 * there is nothing to resolve against the ground and nothing to sink through it. The
 * damping term is a decaying sine, which is the whole reason it does not look like a door
 * closing — the body arrives, settles past, and comes back.
 *
 * Flinch is the same trick at 1/20th the scale on a 0.18 s decay.

 * its receiver, so it sits a little above and behind them. Held **level** rather than dipped
 * into a low ready: a bot spends much of a match shooting, `WeaponSystem` gives this file no
 * firing pose to switch to, and a muzzle pointing at the floor during a firefight is a worse
 * lie than one pointing where the body is facing.

/**
 * Everything every body on the map shares: four materials and four geometries.
 *
 * The geometries are new in round 5 and they are the answer to F4's cost note. Before it,
 * `BotMesh`'s constructor called `buildZoneGeometry` twice and `buildGearGeometry` once **per
 * bot** — ten bodies merging and uploading ten identical copies of the same boxes. Splitting
 * the legs out would have made that thirty. They are built once here and referenced by every
 * mesh, which is what pays for the extra nodes: the draw calls go from three per body to six,
 * and the geometry uploads go from thirty to four for the whole roster.
 *
 * Instancing was considered and refused. One `InstancedMesh` per team would fold the legs into
 * two draw calls, but every limb's world matrix would then have to be composed on the CPU and
 * re-uploaded each frame — and the scene graph is already composing the death fall, the flinch
 * lean, the stance scale and the gait correctly, for free, in the right order. Trading that for
 * draw calls nobody has shown to be the bottleneck is the wrong trade until a frame report says
 * otherwise. It is written down here so the next person has the argument rather than the guess.
