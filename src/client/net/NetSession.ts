/**
 * The client's networked match (M10).
 *
 * ## What this is, in one sentence
 *
 * It turns a socket into things the rest of the client already knows how to draw.
 *
 * ## The event bridge, which is the whole trick
 *
 * S3 sets the requirement: *"Gameplay events still go through the `EventBus`. On the server
 * it drives authority; on the client it drives presentation. **A networked event and a local
 * one must be indistinguishable to the client.**"*
 *
 * So this takes the replicated events off the wire and re-emits them onto the client's own
 * `GameBus` with the same payload shapes M1-M8 already emit. Nothing downstream changes or
 * even knows: the hitmarker, the damage numbers, the killfeed, the impact decals, the tracers,
 * the positional gunfire, the footsteps and the low-health muffle are all wired to those bus
 * entries and keep working with no networking code in them at all.
 *
 * That is why this file is a few hundred lines instead of a rewrite of the presentation
 * layer. The seam M1 built is being cashed in.

     * be conditional on the server having changed its mind.
