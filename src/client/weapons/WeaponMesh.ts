/**
 * Viewmodels, built from primitives in code (brief S2: zero external assets).
 *
 * M2 hand-placed the AR's boxes. M5 needs twelve, and twelve hand-placed weapons is twelve
 * lists of coordinates that drift apart the first time the sight height changes — so the
 * geometry is now a *function* of a `WeaponModelSpec` and the specs are the content. The
 * carbine's spec reproduces M2's proportions; everything else varies from it.
 *
 * Geometry is merged per material, so a whole weapon is five draw calls: three for the
 * static body and two for the parts that move on their own — the magazine and the charging
 * handle (or the pump), which the reload sequence animates independently.
 *
 * Local space matches the viewmodel camera: +X right, +Y up, **-Z forward**, origin at the
 * centre of the receiver. The sights are authored so a line through them sits at
 * `spec.sightHeight` above the origin; that is the number `ViewmodelConfig.adsY` cancels
 * for the sights to land on the screen centre when aimed.
 *
 * Textures are built once per *process* and shared by every model — twelve weapons each
 * generating three 128px canvases would be thirty-six canvases for three distinct images.

/**
 * One weapon as a single merged geometry, for a body seen from the outside (round 5, F4).
 *
 * ## Why not `buildWeaponModel`
 *
 * F4 asks for the weapon in a bot's hands, and the obvious answer — build the viewmodel and
 * parent it to the body — is five draw calls and a fresh set of geometries **per bot**, on a
 * roster of ten, for an object that is between five and fifty metres away and is never
 * reloaded, never aimed down and never animated. The magazine and the charging handle are
 * separate groups in a viewmodel precisely so the reload can move them; nothing out here can
 * see a reload.
 *
 * So this is the same parts through the same specs, merged flat into one geometry with the
 * scale baked in. One draw call, and `BotRenderer` caches it per weapon id so ten bots
 * carrying four distinct weapons build four geometries rather than ten.
 *
 * ## Why it is here and not in `ai/`
 *
 * Round 4's F15 is the reason. `WeaponIcons` was a second description of what a rifle looks
 * like and it drifted; the fix was to project the killfeed's glyph from `WeaponModelSpec`, so
 * there is one source. A hand-typed rifle in `BotMesh` was the *third* description of one — it
 * has been there since M3 and it is what every bot has carried regardless of what
 * `drawBotWeapon` dealt them. This deletes it rather than adding to it.
 *
 * `lens` and `reticle` are skipped for the same reason `WeaponSilhouette` skips them: they are
 * apertures rather than material, and a filled optic window at fifty metres is a black dot on
 * the one part of the weapon that should read as glass. The first-person gloves are not skipped
 * because they are never asked for — `handBoxes` is a part group the viewmodel alone reads, and
 * a body that already has hands does not need a second pair floating beside them.
