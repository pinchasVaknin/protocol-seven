 *
 *  - **The roster**, per tier, which is the wiring itself. A choice that does not reach
 *    `BotDirector` leaves every run with the map's authored spread, and five identical
 *    composition rows is what that looks like.
 *  - **Hit rate and K/D**, which is the table reaching behaviour — and both are **symmetric
 *    measurements in a single-tier match**, which is the trap in reading this table. K/D is
 *    exactly 1.00 in every single-tier row by construction: both sides are the same tier, so
 *    every kill is also a death. Hit rate is symmetric for the same reason and measured
 *    non-monotonic across the four (Hardened came out *below* Regular), because a harder tier is
 *    also harder to hit. Neither is the discriminator.
 *
 * What separates the single-tier runs is the **time to the score limit**, printed on the roster
 * line, because that is the one quantity a symmetric roster does not cancel: ten Veterans reach
 * 75 kills faster than ten Recruits. And the `MIX` row is where per-tier K/D means something at
 * all — there the four fight each other and the ordering is the acceptance claim M3 made.
