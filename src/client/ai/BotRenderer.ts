/**
 * Draws the bots (M9).
 *
 * Until M9 every `Bot` owned a `BotMesh` and `BotDirector` owned the two scene groups the
 * bodies hung from, so the roster could not exist without a renderer. This class is where
 * all of that went. `shared/ai/` now knows nothing about it.
 *
 * Two things it does that are worth stating, because both are the M9 pattern rather than
 * incidental:
 *
 * **The mesh set is reconciled, not subscribed.** Each frame it walks the actor list and
 * makes its own map agree — a body it has no mesh for gets one, a mesh whose actor has gone
 * is disposed. There is no add/remove callback to miss and nothing to unsubscribe.
 *
 * **M10 made good on that.** The prediction in the paragraph above was that the same loop
 * would one day reconcile against a snapshot roster "with no change of shape", and it does:
 * the list is now a supplier of `RenderableActor`, which a local `Bot` and a remote player
 * rebuilt from snapshots both satisfy. S6.5 forbids authoring a second player model and this
 * is how that is enforced by construction rather than by intention — there is no branch here
 * that could tell the two apart.
 *
 * **Animations are started from serials, not from calls.** `BotVisualState` carries a
 * counter per event; this keeps the last value it saw and starts a fall or a flinch when
 * one moves. A frame that never rendered cannot swallow a death.
 *
 * **The weapons are cached here, per id** (round 5, F4). A held weapon is one merged geometry
 * and the roster repeats itself — ten bots draw from an eleven-weapon arsenal, so four or five
 * distinct geometries cover a match. Caching them on the renderer rather than the body means a
 * bot that swaps weapons, or a mesh rebuilt after a respawn, costs a map lookup; caching them
 * for the process would mean holding geometry across map changes for a saving nobody measured.
