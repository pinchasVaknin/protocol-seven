/**
 * The killstreak economy: a balance of kills, what it has been spent on, and how long each
 * streak is locked out for (M11 Gate B, playtest round 4, B9 + B10 and the pivot that followed).
 *
 * ## Why this is a class and not three fields on `StreakSystem`
 *
 * B9 and B10 arrived as one model change. Streaks used to be **thresholds** on
 * `PlayerScore.streak`: crossing twelve opened everything priced at or below twelve at once,
 * activation spliced an entitlement out of a list and the counter never moved, so twelve kills
 * bought a UAV *and* a sentry *and* a chopper. What the report described is a **balance** —
 * kills accumulate, activation debits the price, death zeroes it.
 *
 * ## What replaced "once per life", and why the balance did not change with it
 *
 * B10's answer to a balance degenerating — twelve kills buying the same four-kill UAV three
 * times — was to allow each streak once per life. That rule is **gone**. It was the blunt
 * version of the thing it was protecting: it capped a life at one of each *whatever the pace*,
 * so a player who went on to earn the price a second time over the following two minutes was
 * refused for a reason that had nothing to do with the two minutes. What replaced it is a rule
 * about time rather than about a life:
 *
 *  - **the price is still charged** — re-using a streak means earning it again, in the same
 *    life, which is what makes the wallet the thing that bounds the economy;
 *  - **a cooldown**, `STREAK_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` after the streak's *effect* ends, so the second
 *    UAV of a life is separated from the first by its own duration plus the cooldown;
 *  - **no two of the same at once** — a streak whose previous instance is still in the world
 *    cannot be called in again, which is the rule that stops two choppers and two sentries.
 *
 * The wallet's own rules are untouched by that pivot, and this is the part worth being explicit
 * about because it is where the two models could have been confused: the balance still zeroes
 * on death, still cannot go negative and still cannot cross a life. **The cooldowns
 * deliberately do not** — dying is not a way to shorten a wait — so they are the one thing on a
 * row that `resetLife` leaves alone, and `cooldownsCrossingDeath` is that decision counted
 * rather than asserted.
 *
 * ## The balance is not the score
 *
 * `PlayerScore.kills` is what the match results are made of and nothing here may write it. The
 * balance is credited *from* it — `foldKills` takes the score's own cumulative count and banks
 * the difference, so the score stays the single authority on whether a kill counted at all (a
 * suicide, a team kill in a team mode) and this class never re-decides it — and it is credited
 * *beside* it by `credit`, which is how a care package pays out and how F14's `MO951357` hands
 * somebody thirty kills of purchasing power without touching what the scoreboard says they did.
 * If the balance were a read of `PlayerScore.kills`, neither of those would be expressible, and
 * that is the signal the model would be wrong.
 *
 * ## Nothing here knows what a streak *does*
 *
 * Prices come in from the caller, already discounted by Hardline; so does the tick a cooldown
 * ends on, and so does the answer to "is one of these already flying". This file has no opinion
 * about perks, entities or the world, which is what lets a harness drive a whole match's
 * economy through it and audit the result — see `report`.
