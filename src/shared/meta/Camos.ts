/**
 * Weapon camouflages (brief S6.5): six. The patterns themselves are generated in `client/meta/CamoTextures.ts`.
 *
 * Zero external assets (S2), so every one of these is drawn with 2D canvas calls from a
 * seeded `Rng` — which also means they are reproducible: the same camo is byte-identical
 * across reloads, and a pattern that looked wrong can be tuned by changing one number
 * rather than by re-exporting an image.
 *
 * They are *not* six recolourings of the same noise. Each generator is a different
 * construction, because the whole point of a camo unlock is that the reward is visibly a
 * different thing:
 *
 * | Camo     | Construction                                                  |
 * |----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | DIGITAL  | Aligned pixel grid, three-tone, blocks biased by a value field |
 * | SPLINTER | Straight-edged angular shards from a random half-plane cut     |
 * | TIGER    | Sinusoidally warped horizontal stripes with broken ends        |
 * | FRACTAL  | Summed octaves of value noise, posterised to four bands        |
 * | GOLD     | Vertical brushed metal with a specular sweep and an edge burn  |
 * | OBSIDIAN | Voronoi facets lit from one direction, over an ink base        |
 *
 * OBSIDIAN is S6.5's "one that requires the others" — it is earned by earning the five above
 * it, so it cannot be reached any other way.
 *
 * **A camo belongs to the weapon that earned it** (playtest, 2026-09-23). The requirements
 * below always said "with the weapon"; until that date the save did not, and 25 kills with the
 * carbine put DIGITAL on every gun in the game. Ownership is a field on each weapon's own
 * record now (`WeaponSaveData.camos`), the rule that fills it is `camosEarnedBy`, and OBSIDIAN
 * is counted on the weapon holding the other five rather than across the account.
