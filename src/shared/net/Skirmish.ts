 * Which ballot just *appeared*, or `null` for no opening (playtest round 4, F13).
 *
 * ## One detector over the phase, not one per ballot
 *
 * The first version of this answered only the map ballot, because F13 names the map and because
 * "one sound per cycle" was a tidy thing to be able to assert. Both were wrong reasons. The
 * **mode** ballot is the one that opens the whole twenty-second question while the player is
 * mid-firefight, and it arrived in silence — so the cue was missing from the moment it was most
 * needed, and a second detector beside this one is how that gets fixed twice.
 *
 * The rule is a property of the phase machine rather than of either ballot: a ballot has opened
 * when the phase becomes a ballot it was not already. `PLAY -> MODE_VOTE` and
 * `MODE_VOTE -> MAP_VOTE` are both openings; the forty broadcasts inside either one are not.
 *
 * ## Why the two do not sound the same
 *
 * They are two stages of one question, so they should be recognisably the same event and
 * distinguishable without looking up. `ProceduralAudio.playBallotOpen` takes the phase and
 * pitches the same two-note figure from it — the map ballot a fourth above the mode ballot — so
 * the second cue says *the mode is settled, the map is the question now* to a player who never
 * takes their eyes off the fight. One generator, two pitches, rather than two sounds.
 *
 * ## The trap this exists to avoid
 *
 * Vote state is broadcast at 4 Hz. Anything hung off the broadcast rather than off the change
 * fires at the broadcast rate — measured, 43 times across one ten-second ballot. Holding the
 * previous phase and acting only on the difference is the general form, and it is why this takes
 * `previous` as an argument instead of keeping a flag: the caller already has the old phase,
 * `VoteOverlay.apply` in the browser and `HeadlessClient.onVoteState` in the harness, and
 * neither has anything extra to reset.
 *
 * `IDLE` for `previous` is not a special case: a client that has just been migrated back into
 * the arena mid-ballot has genuinely just had one appear in front of it.
