/**
 * The match intro's camera path (M15, Phase C): a plan, not a player.
 *
 * ## What it hides, and what it is
 *
 * The brief called this a hidden loading screen. In this project there is nothing to hide —
 * the connected path builds the next map during the previous match's summary (§6.5), the
 * solo path before `MATCH` — but there *is* the round-one freeze, in which the player stands
 * at spawn unable to move. The intro is client-only presentation over a built world during a
 * freeze the server already runs. Nothing goes on the wire.
 *
 * ## The freeze is sized to the intro, not the other way round (M17, C2)
 *
 * The freeze used to be ten seconds flat, and the plan was fitted into it: 3.5 s of approach,
 * 1.5 of pull-back, 3.5 for the objectives, 0.5 of return and 1.0 of the player's own view.
 * The report was that it was *"too aggressive and disjointed"*, and the human's decision was
 * the other way about: *"the camera should take the exact time it needs; the 5 seconds is
 * strictly the countdown after the camera finishes its overview."* So `matchStartSeconds`
 * is now a function of the map and the mode — `introSeconds` (the phases' own budgets, with
 * the objectives counted) plus the return blend plus `COUNTDOWN_SECONDS` — and the server
 * and the client compute the same number from the same two facts, which is what lets a
 * replicated client back out the freeze's total from the seconds remaining on the wire. The
 * plan still fills its budget and holds the last pose for whatever it did not use, because
 * an approach's length is the player's spawn's and the freeze cannot be.
 *
 * ## Three phases, then the countdown
 *
 * The plan's segments fill `introSeconds`; the return blend follows, and then the countdown
 * in the player's own eyes — a player looking through a cinematic camera when the round goes
 * live has been ambushed by their own UI, and five seconds is the human's number for reading
 * the room and the quick class selector:
 *
 *  1. **The approach** — spawn to the map's centre on the bots' own route (`Pathfinder` over
 *     the match's `NavGrid`, a second instance so the bots' queue is untouched), a filleted
 *     polyline through the waypoints at eye height, the heading the route's own averaged
 *     over a few metres either side so a corner is turned into rather than snapped round,
 *     pitch held a few degrees down. A distance/time profile eased at both ends with a
 *     ceiling: a route longer than the ceiling allows is **trimmed from the spawn end**, not
 *     sped up, because the approach reads as a person moving or it does not read.
 *  2. **The overview** — a pull-back from the centre, **straight back along the heading the
 *     approach arrived on** and up at 45°, so the camera rises away from what it was looking
 *     at and its heading never moves while it climbs (it used to pull back along the spawn's
 *     azimuth while looking past the centre, and the two disagreeing is what was reported as
 *     *"while climbing at 45 degrees, the camera continues to rotate"*); to the distance at
 *     which the map's half-diagonal fits the lens, clamped by the first collider the ray
 *     meets (a roof, a wall), else the *smallest turn* of a fan around it that clears —
 *     computed, never tuned per map. On a turned ray the heading **eases once**, with the
 *     climb, from the approach's to the map's centre, and ends on it: a heading that held
 *     while the ray turned put the camera beside the map looking past it (playtest,
 *     2026-09-20: *"the map is not in the centre of the camera but to the left"* — measured
 *     at 30° to 150° off-axis on twelve of Foundry's sixteen spawns). Straight back, the two
 *     headings are the same and nothing turns, which is the previous report's fix kept.
 *  3. **The objectives**, after a rest on the overview — Domination's flags in label order,
 *     Search & Destroy's two sites:
 *     a snap down to each, a hold with its label, a whip to the next along a nav route with
 *     the speed profile inverted (fast in the middle, eased into the hold). A route the grid
 *     cannot find falls back to an arc above the map, never through it. Team Deathmatch,
 *     Free-for-All and Kill Confirmed hold the overview instead.
 *
 * ## Pure, so it can be proved
 *
 * Loose numbers, `shared/` maths, no `three`, no clock: the same function runs in the client
 * on the freeze's first frame and in `npm run intro` on the server build, where every map ×
 * mode is planned, sampled every 25 cm and tested against the map's own `CollisionWorld`.
 * The plan reports what it trimmed and what it could not route, so the harness prints a
 * number rather than a shrug.

 * either side, and the bots' string-pulled route hugs every corner at the capsule's radius,
 * so an overshoot of any size is an overshoot into the thing the route was pulled around.
 * Each corner is rounded with a quadratic fillet of at most `FILLET` metres instead — a cut
 * of `FILLET × 0.29` at a right angle, three and a half centimetres, inside the four the
 * route keeps clear of `EYE_RADIUS` at head height — and the heading, not the position, is

 *
