/**
 * The front end (brief S6.7; rebuilt on the design frame by M15, A2): main -> play -> match.
 *
 * ## Two halves, and the chrome on the window
 *
 * A header, a stage and a footer. The **header** is the wordmark on the left and the player
 * card on the right — the callsign, editable in place, and the profile line under it — where
 * the references put them. The **stage** is the left half, which is nothing but the backdrop
 * (the canvas underneath, which A3 fills with a map on a dolly), and the right half, which
 * holds the navigation: four buttons, and only four, because that is how many places there
 * are to go — PLAY (multiplayer, primary, one click to the arena as §6.1 requires), PLAY
 * SOLO, CREATE A CLASS and SETTINGS. The reference has six; ZOMBIES and STORE do not exist
 * here and QUIT is out by decision 7, a tab being a thing that closes itself. The **footer**
 * carries one line, bottom left — FIGHT · SURVIVE · WIN, the human's (playtest round 3,
 * decision 9) — where it used to carry `Game.statusLine()`'s map, brush and prop counts, an
 * M1 build stat nobody reading a menu could use (R1.3).
 *
 * The stage is in the frame; the header and the footer are on the **viewport** (playtest
 * round 3, R1.1). The frame is a 16:9 box centred in the window, and a window wider than
 * that — a maximised browser under its own bar — leaves a gutter each side of it, so a header
 * laid out in the frame stood 142 px from the window's edge where the eye expects the
 * padding. The viewport is the window's own size in frame pixels (`Frame.ts`); the two bars
 * are absolute against it, flush with the window's sides, and the menu's frame is the one
 * that fills the viewport (`app.css`, `.op-menu`: there is no fixed body here to keep
 * uniform, and a column held to 16:9 would stand inside the card above it). At 16:9 nothing
 * moves.
 *
 * The controls card, the fullscreen hint and the reset control that used to stack under the
 * buttons are in Settings → INFO now (A4, `KeyCard.ts`): the menu has no room for fourteen
 * rows in this layout, and none of the three is a thing that should greet a player.
 *
 * ## The buttons are cut, not boxed
 *
 * "Not standard rigid boxes" is the brief's phrase, and it is three declarations in
 * `app.css`: a `clip-path` polygon that skews the leading edge, a `mask-image` that dissolves
 * the primary's leading end into the backdrop rather than ending it on a line, and a
 * pseudo-element that sweeps a highlight along the skew on hover. No image, because there are
 * none (M12's first paragraph), and the look reads the same at every scale of the frame.
 *
 * ## Play Solo is a panel, not a page
 *
 * The mode / map / difficulty pickers used to replace the whole screen. They slide in over
 * the stage now and the header and footer stay where they are, so going to pick a map is not
 * leaving the menu. The slide is 16 px and the frame's padding is 64, so a probe that
 * measures the panel on the frame it was inserted into finds it inside the window even at
 * the first keyframe.
 *
 * Pointer lock can only be requested from a user gesture, so the button that starts a match
 * is genuinely load-bearing rather than a formality.
