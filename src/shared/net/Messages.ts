/**
 * Gameplay events the client needs to *present* something for (S4.15).
 *
 * The table in S4.15 is explicit that cosmetics are **driven by replicated events, not
 * replicated state**: the server says `damage.dealt` and the client decides what that looks
 * and sounds like.
 *
 * ## One judgement call, named rather than glossed (M11 Gate B, S8.25)
 *
 * This comment used to claim there was *"deliberately no tracer, decal or particle anywhere in
 * it"*, and `FiredEvent.tracer` is a few lines below — the comment was simply wrong, and a
 * comment that lies about the audit it describes is worse than no comment. The audit is now
 * `scripts/check-cosmetics.mjs`, which is a check that fails rather than a sentence that
 * asserts.
 *
 * The tracer bit stays, and here is the actual argument for it. S8.25's requirement is that no
 * cosmetic state appears in a **snapshot**, and it does not: the entity snapshot is nineteen
 * fields of position, velocity, stance, health, weapon and event counters, pinned by that check.
 * `tracer` rides an *event*, which is the channel S4.15 says cosmetics are supposed to be driven
 * by. It is one bit meaning "this shot was a tracer round" — a fact about which round in the
 * magazine this was, which the firing side knows and a receiving client cannot recover across
 * packet loss without counting shots it may not have seen. The client still owns what a tracer
 * looks like, how long it lives and whether to draw one at all.
 *
 * What would be a violation, and is not present: a position for the tracer, a particle count, a
 * decal id, a muzzle-flash intensity, a viewmodel pose, a camera-shake magnitude.

 * The first frame on a connection — and it carries the player's class (M11, Tier 1 #20) and,
 * since v18, the body they wear (M16, B6).
 *
 * ## The skin, one byte after the name
 *
 * `skinIndex` is a position in `SKIN_IDS` or `NO_SKIN_INDEX`, and it is sent by every
 * connection with no presence byte (M16 decision 3): 255 *is* the absence, and a presence
 * byte would be a second way to say it. It sits after the name and ahead of the class because
 * it is a fact every connection has, which is what the token's rule below is about. It is a
 * *setting*, not part of the class — a respawn changes classes, not bodies — so the `Loadout`
 * message does not carry it, and a pick made mid-connection is the next connection's.
 *
 * ## Why the loadout is here and not in a message that follows
 *
 * The seat is created **inside the handshake**: `onJoin` calls `addPlayer`, which builds the
 * `NetPlayer` whose constructor sets `controller.speedScale` from the resolved perks. A class
 * that arrives in a later frame therefore arrives after the entity it was meant to configure,
 * and for every tick in between the client predicts with Lightweight's +7% while the server
 * simulates without it.
 *
 * That window is not theoretical and it is not small. Measured with the class sent one frame
 * later: **178 mispredictions in 1277 comparisons** across a warmup period, against 0 once it
 * moved into the handshake. It is Tier 1 #20 in miniature — the same arithmetic, the same
 * cause, just bounded by how long the player stays in the arena rather than forever.
 *
 * A trailing optional field, so a client that has no class yet (the first ever run, before the
 * M6 save exists) simply omits it and gets the server defaults.
 *
 * ## And the reconnect token, behind it (playtest round 4, F8)
 *
 * *"I was here a moment ago and this is my seat."* Optional in exactly the same way and for the
 * same reason: a first connection has nothing to present, and presenting a token nobody
 * recognises is an ordinary join rather than an error. Sent last so the class — which every
 * connection has an opinion about — is not behind a field most of them omit.
 *
 * The server never trusts it beyond looking it up: see `ReconnectRegistry.claim` for what it
 * refuses, and `RECONNECT_TOKEN_BYTES` for why guessing one is the attack it is designed
 * against.
