/**
 * Which team-score accessor is correct on a replicated client (playtest round 5, B7).
 *
 * The report was the game accusing itself: dozens of `error` lines saying *"scoreA — client
 * says 0, server says 69"*. It was right about the zero and wrong about whose fault it was.
 * `GameMode.teamScore` is the local copy of a fact the server has owned since M10, and
 * `MatchFlow` sets a replicated client up with `authoritative: false` — under which the mode
 * never scores. So for four of the five modes the local copy is not stale, not lagging and not
 * off by a few: it is a **structural constant zero**, and anything comparing it against the
 * server's number reports a divergence in every networked match.
 *
 * This is the numeric half of the fix. `scripts/check-authority.mjs` is the structural half: it
 * stops a client file reaching for the wrong accessor and cannot say what the wrong one
 * returns. Together they are "which one, and why".
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * For every registered mode, on the first map that authors its objectives, it builds a
 * **replicated** flow — the client's arrangement, not the server's — replays a run of lethal
 * damage events through it, hands it a snapshot state the way `NetSession` does, and asks both
 * accessors what the score is. Then it asserts the two things a client depends on:
 *
 * - `MatchFlow.teamScore` returns the replicated number, for every mode. That is what the HUD,
 *   the pause screen, the debug panel and the divergence checker must read.
 * - `GameMode.teamScore` does **not**, and the audit prints what it does return, because the
 *   count of modes where it happens to track is the whole reason this looked plausible for a
 *   milestone. Free-for-All's score is the leader's kill count, which the replicated path does
 *   maintain — so one mode in five looked fine and four screamed.
 *
 * Pure: a throwaway bus, score and mode per row, nothing subscribed that outlives the call, no
 * clock and no wire. One run is a fact rather than a sample, which is what puts it beside
 * `auditModeBriefs` and `auditRosterDeal` at the top of a harness run rather than inside one.
 *
 * ## The rows too (M13 Phase B, bug 4.3)
 *
 * Since Phase B a networked client's rows are the server's, delivered whole by
 * `MsgS.Scoreboard` and applied by `ScoreSystem.applyReplicated`. That path has exactly one
 * caller — `MatchWorld`, in the browser — which no harness runs, and a shared method with one
 * caller the harness never invokes is the shape round 5's B7 found broken. So `auditReplica`
 * drives the replica directly: a board arrives, a smaller board arrives (a row removed), the
 * replicated kill events that used to build the board arrive — and the rows must be the last
 * board's, no more and no less, with the row objects the board bound still the same objects.
