/**
 * Does this client's mode state agree with the server's? (M11, S7, S8.21)
 *
 * S7: *"State-divergence checker: hash authoritative mode state on the instance and on each
 * client, logging any mismatch with the tick it appeared on."* S8.21 makes it a gate — *"any
 * mismatch is this milestone's blocking bug — report it, do not explain it away."*
 *
 * ## What this used to claim, and why it was wrong (playtest round 5, B7)
 *
 * It used to compare the score two ways and call them independent:
 *
 * - **From replicated events.** Kills arrive as `damage.dealt`, go through the same
 *   `ScoreSystem` a local match uses, and the mode derives a team score from the rows.
 * - **From the snapshot header.** The server's own `mode.teamScore`, stated outright.
 *
 * The first of those does not exist. `MatchFlow` sets a replicated client up with
 * `authoritative: false`, and its kill handler says so outright — *"The mode must not run here
 * ... the server has already scored this kill and replicated the total"*. So `mode.teamScore`
 * on a dedicated server is not an independent tally. For Team Deathmatch, Domination, Kill
 * Confirmed and Search & Destroy it is a **structural constant zero**: all four read a team
 * total that only `GameMode.addTeamScore` writes, and the mode never runs. The comparison was
 * therefore zero against the server's score, and it fired — correctly, by its own rules — in
 * every networked match of those four modes as soon as a score survived four snapshots. That
 * is B7, verbatim, off the deployed build:
 *
 *     DIVERGENCE on tick 67010: scoreA — client says 0, server says 69.
 *
 * Free-for-All was the exception, and it is why this looked plausible for a milestone: its
 * `teamScore` is the highest kill count among its own rows, which the replicated path *does*
 * maintain. Even there it was only ever right for a client present since the first kill — one
 * that joined or rejoined mid-match starts its tally at zero and never catches up.
 *
 * **A client on a dedicated server cannot audit the server's arithmetic.** It holds strictly
 * less than the server held when it computed the number, and no amount of comparing gets that
 * back. Pretending otherwise produced an error line per snapshot for a whole milestone.
 *
 * ## So what it checks now, and which half can fail
 *
 * **The state hash, and this is the one with teeth.** The instance hashes its authoritative
 * mode state and sends it last, after every channel describing that tick; the client hashes
 * what it ended up holding, and the two are compared. That catches the whole class of fault
 * living between those two points — a channel that stopped, a field truncated by an encoder
 * change on one side, a list capped differently, a frame applied to the wrong mode after a
 * migration. `ModeStateHash` has the full list and, more importantly, what it does not catch.
 *
 * **The flow against the header, and this half is a guard rather than an audit.** Phase,
 * round, the clock and the score are all *assigned* to the client's inert `MatchFlow` from the
 * header by `NetSession`, so they agree by construction, and they are named here as such. They
 * are still compared because it costs four comparisons and because "something wrote to the
 * flow behind the header's back" is a fault this project has actually had: round 2's phase
 * leak was exactly that — a client sitting in `MATCH_END` with a stale banner while the server
 * had moved on. What it is not, and what the previous version of this comment claimed it was,
 * is a second opinion about the score.
 *
 * ## Latency is not divergence
 *
 * Handover standing lesson 3: *"A client's copy is one snapshot stale, always. Any comparator
 * checking live server state against client state must tolerate latency on continuously-varying
 * values and confirm-before-reporting on discrete ones. Exact equality is a broken test, not a
 * found bug."*
 *
 * That shapes both halves of this:
 *
 * - `timeLeft` is **continuously varying** and is compared with a tolerance, because the client
 *   is always some fraction of a second behind and always will be.
 * - The hash, the scores, the phase and the round are **discrete**, and a mismatch on them is
 *   confirmed across several consecutive samples before it is reported. A single disagreeing
 *   sample is an in-flight update, not a divergence; the same disagreement surviving four
 *   snapshots is.
 *
 * Without the confirm step this reports a mismatch on essentially every kill, which is the
 * flaky-probe failure standing lesson 6 warns about — a check that cries wolf teaches its
 * reader to ignore it, and then it is worse than not existing.
 *
 * ## Shared, so the browser and the harness run the same checker (M11 Gate B)
 *
 * It moved out of `client/debug` for S8.21, which asks for zero mismatches *across a full match
 * in each of the five modes* — five matches nobody is going to sit through by hand. Nothing in
 * here was ever client-only: it reads a snapshot header and a `MatchFlow`, both shared. Two
 * copies of a comparator is two comparators that can disagree about what agreement means.
 *
 * That argument had a hole in it until round 5, and the hole is why B7 survived a milestone of
 * green harness runs: this class had exactly **one** caller, `MatchWorld`, in the browser.
 * `HeadlessClient` never used it — it compares state hashes directly, with a streak counter of
 * its own — so the comparator the gate exercised and the comparator the player ran were not the
 * same code. The browser runs the hash check too now, through `checkHash` below.
