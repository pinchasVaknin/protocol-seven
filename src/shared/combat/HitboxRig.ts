/**
 * Oriented-box hitbox rig (brief S6.3).
 *
 * Built here, in M2, against static dummies where the multipliers can be verified
 * against printed damage numbers. M3's bots attach the same rig unchanged — retrofitting
 * it later would touch the whole damage path.
 *
 * A rig is real geometry: head, torso, two arms, two legs. Not one capsule. Ray tests
 * run against the entity's own box set and never touch the scene graph.
 *
 * Layouts are shared (every humanoid points at the same few `RigLayout`s); only the
 * transform and the choice of layout are per-entity. Nothing here allocates: hits are
 * written into a caller-owned record.
 *
 * ## One layout per drawn pose (M13 C2)
 *
 * M3 compressed the standing layout uniformly by the capsule height — 0.61 crouched, 0.31
 * sliding. The skinned bodies that arrived with M12 ignore that number and play a clip, and
 * C1 measured where the clip actually puts the head: the crouch idle is a **kneel** with the
 * crown at 1.11 m (the squashed rig said 1.08 — fine), the crouch walk holds it at 1.26 m
 * (+0.18 m over the rig) and the crouch run, which is what a slide draws while it is fast,
 * at 1.38 m against a slide rig 0.54 m tall. A round aimed at a sliding body's head passed
 * over everything it could hit.
 *
 * So the low stances now have layouts of their own, built from the measured joints of the
 * clip they are drawn with (`scripts/measure-crouch.mjs --pose`), and `rigLayoutFor` picks
 * one by the same rule the animation selector uses to pick the clip. The standing layout is
 * untouched: every hit-rate number in the plan was taken against it.
 *
 * A fourth low layout arrived with the pistol family (M13 decision 11, settled this session):
 * a sidearm is drawn crouching in a half-squat rather than a kneel, 10.9 cm of crown apart, so
 * `rigLayoutFor` takes what is in the hands as well. It is still one rule and not two — see the
 * note there for why the fallback is what makes an incomplete clip family safe.
