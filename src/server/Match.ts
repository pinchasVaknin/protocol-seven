/**
 * A match, running with no renderer (brief S6.4).
 *
 * This is the milestone's gate made into a class: a `MapDef` in, colliders and a navmesh
 * baked, ten bots spawned, a `GameMode` ticking on the shared simulation, and a result out.
 * **No transport.** M9 explicitly builds no networking, so this runs alone; M10 wraps it.
 *
 * ## What it is not
 *
 * It is not `client/ClientMatch.ts` with the drawing removed. That file is the *client's*
 * composition root — it owns a viewmodel, a HUD, an audio graph, a camera rig and a local
 * player, and it is right that it does. This owns the authoritative half and nothing else,
 * which is why it is about a tenth of the size. The shared systems underneath are literally
 * the same modules; only the wiring differs.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately absent
 *
 * - **No local player.** S4.9: every player is a client. The roster's player seat is a
 *   `Spectator` that never participates — the same mechanism the M3 AFK harness used.
 * - **No weapons for a human, no viewmodel, no melee.** Bots draw their own weapons
 *   (`ai/BotArsenal`), and the rest of that list is a local-player presentation system.
 * - **Killstreaks run here and cross the wire as of M11 Gate B** (§8.22). Earned from the
 *   authoritative score, spent through `MsgC.Streak`, replicated per recipient — bodies to
 *   everyone, earn state to their owner, UAV contacts to their team.
 * - **Equipment runs here as of M11 Gate B, and only half of it is replicated** (§8.24). The
 *   authoritative half is complete: bots throw, humans throw from the command their body just
 *   consumed, blasts resolve through the one damage door, and smoke occludes bot LOS — §6.8's
 *   requirement, and one that could only ever have been met here, because the bots whose sight
 *   is blocked live in this process.
 *
 *   What is **not** done is the projectile channel. A client predicts and draws its *own*
 *   grenade correctly — same command, same tick, same trajectory on both sides — but a grenade
 *   thrown by a bot or another player exists on the server, damages people, and is invisible.
 *   Named here rather than left to be found: this is §8.24's first half.
 * - **No progression.** `MatchProgression` needs a `ProgressionStore`, and S4.16 says there is
 *   no server database. XP is awarded server-side from M10 and persisted client-side.
