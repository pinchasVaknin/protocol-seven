   * **The optic is a red dot, and that is B2's actual fix** (playtest round 4, and corrected
   * after it). This spec used to say `optic: 'scope'` while `AR_LONGBOW` has no `scope` block in
   * `WeaponDefs` — and those two facts drive different machinery. `WeaponDef.scope` is what
   * `ClientMatch` tests to hide the viewmodel at `SCOPE_VIEWMODEL_HIDDEN` and hand the picture to
   * `HudTactical`'s overlay; `WeaponModelSpec.optic` is what decides the geometry. With the
   * first false and the second `'scope'`, aiming this rifle put the tube's own end cap on the
   * sight line with nothing to replace it. That is the reported *"closed crosshair on one
   * particular AR"*, and it was one weapon because it was the only disagreement.
   *
   * Round 4 fixed the mesh instead of the mismatch — it opened the tube's ends so the eye could
   * see through — and that was wrong twice over. It did not restore a sight *picture*, only a
   * hole; and an open cylinder is a single-sided surface, so at hip fire, where the camera sits
   * behind the weapon and looks along it, all three scoped weapons became a hollow trough with a
   * reticle floating in it. Reported immediately, with screenshots.
   *
   * So the tube geometry is back to exactly what it was, and the mismatch is fixed at the end
   * that was actually wrong. A red dot is a sight this weapon can aim through, built by the same
   * M7 code the SMGs and the HALCYON use — which the same report confirms works — and it costs
   * nothing in the simulation: no magnification, no scope-in time, no breath, no sway, no
   * `WeaponDefs` edit at all. The rifle keeps its identity from its proportions, which is where
   * it always came from: the longest handguard and barrel in the game, a skeleton stock and a
   * short magazine.
   *
   * `check-optics` now fails the build if a spec ever pairs a scope model with an unscoped def
   * again, because this is the second playtest in a row to report the consequence.
