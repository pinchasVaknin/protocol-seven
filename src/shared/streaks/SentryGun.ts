/**
 * Sentry Gun (brief S6.1): placeable, auto-targets, destructible, 90 s.
 *
 * ## "It should use the *bot* aim model, not a perfect one"
 *
 * That line is the whole design of this file, and it is why the sentry owns a real
 * `CombatBehaviour` and a real `BotBlackboard` rather than a `lookAt` and a timer. Everything
 * that makes a bot miss applies unchanged:
 *
 *  - The aim is slewed at a turn rate, so a sentry cannot answer somebody who walks behind it
 *    instantly — it has to physically come round.
 *  - `onContact` snaps the error out to the first-burst cone, so the opening rounds are wrong
 *    on purpose and the target is *told* it is being shot at before it can be killed.
 *  - The error then converges, so standing still in front of a sentry gets steadily worse.
 *  - The trigger is gated on the aim having arrived, so it never sprays through a turn.
 *
 * The sentry gets its own `TierConfig` rather than borrowing a bot's, because a turret is not a
 * difficulty setting — but every *field* is one a bot tier has, so the model is genuinely
 * shared rather than re-implemented. Acceptance criterion 7 asks for the hit rate, and
 * `shotsFired`/`shotsHit` are counted here for exactly that.
 *
 * ## Destructible, and Cold-Blooded
 *
 * The sentry is a `Damageable` with a `HitboxRig`, registered with `DamageSystem` like any
 * combatant — so shooting it down uses the ordinary ballistics path and produces an ordinary
 * killfeed entry. `ctx.targetable` is the M6 Cold-Blooded hook: a target that fails it is never
 * acquired, which is the perk's entire effect and is invisible to this class.
