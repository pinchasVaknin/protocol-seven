     *
     * ```
     *   y: 5.00  0.00  5.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  5.00  0.00   mm
     * ```
     *
     * a 5 mm vertical limit cycle — exactly `collisionSkin` — running at twenty-odd hertz
     * forever. Gravity drives the capsule 2.7 mm into the floor each tick; `resolve` pushes
     * it back out by `depth + skin`, which overshoots to 5 mm *above* the floor; from there
     * it is no longer touching anything, so the next tick has no contact, `groundSnap` pulls
     * it back down, and the cycle repeats. Five millimetres is nothing at arm's length and
     * 0.82° of pitch against a wall 0.35 m away — about ten pixels of judder at this FOV,
     * which is why the report is specifically *"when the player gets right up close"*. It is
     * visible only when there is something near enough to reference it against.
     *
     * That is the jitter. It was never the depth buffer and never the step-up, and rounds 2
     * and 3 spent themselves on both.
     *
     * The same accumulation is the ice-slide on ramps. `projectVelocity` removes the
     * component of velocity going *into* the surface and correctly leaves the tangential
     * part — so on a slope, gravity's downhill component builds up every tick until friction
     * balances it, which is a steady creep downhill with no input. Measured before this:
     * 292 mm in three seconds on 18°, 766 mm on 44°.
     *
     * Both are the same wrong assumption: that a player standing on the floor is falling. A
     * grounded player is *supported*. Gravity resumes the moment the ground stops being
     * there, and `groundSnapDist` — 0.4 m — is what keeps the player attached walking over a
     * crest or down a slope, which is the job it already had.
     *
     * The two guards are exactly the two ways `vy` can legitimately be non-falling on a

  /**
   * Why the slide ends this tick, or null.
   *
   * **The crouch key is not one of the reasons** (2026-09-28). A slide used to last exactly as
   * long as the key was held, so a tap made a 50 ms slide that read as a dropped input and still
   * paid the full cooldown and tac-sprint lockout. It is committed now: the press starts all of
   * it, `slideDuration` long, and only the world or a jump ends it early — which is also what
   * lets the third-person clip be fitted to it, since a slide has a length the clip can know.
   *
   * That makes the wall a reason. `slideSpeed` is the curve, not the body: into a wall head on,
   * `integrateMotion` projects the velocity away and `stepSlide` writes the curve's speed back
   * next tick, so a held key used to be the only way out of pressing into the wall for the rest
   * of the slide. `sim.speed` is the velocity collision left, so the body stopping ends the slide
   * the way the curve running down does. Along a wall at an angle it keeps the tangential part and
   * carries on, which is a slide.
