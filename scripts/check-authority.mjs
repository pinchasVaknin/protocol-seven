/**
 * Facts the server owns, and the local copies the client must stop reading (round 5, B7).
 *
 * This milestone's recurring failure, in P0's words: *"a fact that moved to the server breaks
 * every reader of the local copy, silently."* Silently is the operative word — the local copy
 * still compiles, still has the right type, and still returns a number. It returns **zero**,
 * and zero is a plausible score, so nothing anywhere says a word.
 *
 * B7 is that failure with the volume turned up. The team score moved onto the snapshot header
 * at M10; `MatchFlow.teamScore()` is the accessor that knows it and prefers the replicated
 * value; `GameMode.teamScore()` is the local copy, and `MatchFlow`'s replicated path
 * deliberately never scores, so on a dedicated server it is a structural constant zero. Three
 * client call sites still read it. Two of them quietly printed `0 – 0` for a whole match and
 * nobody reported it. The third was the divergence checker, which compared its own zero against
 * the server's score and logged an `error` line per confirmed sample — which is how this became
 * the one item in the round the game reported about itself.
 *
 * ## Why a grep and not a type
 *
 * Both accessors are `(team: ScoreTeam) => number`. No type distinguishes "the server's answer"
 * from "the copy nobody writes any more", and inventing a branded type for one field would be a
 * lot of machinery around one call. A grep is the same instrument `check-cheats` uses for the
 * same reason: the rule is about *which of two indistinguishable things you reached for*, and
 * the cheapest honest enforcement is to name the wrong one.
 *
 * Add a row when the next fact migrates. That is the point of the table: the next migration
 * gets a check for free, and the one after that does not have to remember this happened.
