   * **players killable** — and this is the second one, off.
   *
   * `team !== undefined` is what separates the two populations, and it is the meaning that

   * selects targets from this system's list and a client has no remote player registered in it.
   * So refusing the *deduction* changes only a number the client is told. Refusing the
   * *computation* would have to happen in `nearestTarget`, which moves where the round stops —
   * and the terminus is replicated in `FiredEvent`, drawn as a tracer and an impact on every
