# PROTOCOL SEVEN — PLAN

Browser arena FPS. This file is the handover: what exists, what was decided, and what the next
milestone needs to know. A fresh session inherits the repository and this file, nothing else.

M1–M8 built a complete single-player browser game. M9–M11 moved it onto a dedicated external
server: the split first, then the netcode, then everything else on top of it. M12 is the scoped
content backlog, M13 (archived) put skinned bodies on the bots and moved the board and the XP
award to the server, M14 (archived) put vitest in the gate and legacy decorators behind a fence,
M15 (archived) rebuilt the front end to fit one screen, M16 (archived) put the player's chosen
body on the wire, M17 (archived) gave the front end its second pass from the human's "Fixes /
Design" brief, and M18 — the debrief, the end-of-match screen as the human's two-screen
choreography — is the milestone now in progress, under Milestone 12, the content backlog. Both
are below, in full.

**Survival mode is cancelled** — permanently, not deferred. See "Roadmap update — post-M8" in
[12-post-m8-round-4.md](docs/archive/plan/12-post-m8-round-4.md).

## Where the record is

The closed sections of this file were moved to `docs/archive/plan/` on 2026-09-14 (baseline
`29533b2`), one file per section, verbatim, in the order they were written. Each file opens
with the line range it came from. A code comment that says "see PLAN.md, M5 notes" resolves
here: find the row, open the file.

This index makes no claim about what is complete. The honest answer to that question is the
"What Gate B still needs" list in [17-m11-gate-b-in-progress.md](docs/archive/plan/17-m11-gate-b-in-progress.md), as the Milestone 12 section below says.

What stays in this file: **Milestone 12 — proposed** (the content backlog) and **Milestone 18 —
the debrief**, the milestone now in progress.

## How this file stays short

This file holds exactly three things: the index above, the content backlog, and the one
milestone in progress. Nothing else. When a milestone closes — in the session that closes it,
before the summary — its whole section moves, verbatim, to `docs/archive/plan/NN-slug.md` with
the provenance line the other files carry, and gets a row in the index; the `## Playtest round`
sections that accumulated under it go with it. Lines move; nothing is rewritten. `npm run
check:plan` refuses a third `# ` section here and an index that disagrees with the folder, so this
is a gate rather than a habit — the same reason the boundary check exists.

# Milestone 12 — proposed: the large content

Playtest round 4's remaining five items — **F4** (character skins and 3D models), **F5** (a
story), **F6** (more maps), **F16** (minigun, flamethrower, riot shield) and **F17** (a detailed
grenade-throw animation). None of them is a defect and none of them is small. This section is a
scoped estimate in the shape of the one that cancelled Survival: what the existing structure
already answers, what it does not, what each item breaks, and the decisions that are the human's
rather than mine. **No product code was written in this session.**

## The constraint that decides nearly everything

**This project has no asset files.** Not "few" — none. Measured this session: `src/`, `public/`
and `index.html` hold **296 `.ts` files, 5 `.css` files and 0 files of any image, model, audio,
font or environment format**. The only thing under `public/` is eight verification scripts.
Everything the player sees and hears is generated at runtime by code, and the code that does it
is **5 118 lines across sixteen files** — `ProceduralTextures`, `ProceduralAudio`, `AudioSpecs`,
`FxAssets`, `CamoTextures`, `BotMesh`, `StreakMeshes`, `WeaponMesh`, `WeaponMeshParts`,
`WeaponModelSpecs`, `WeaponSilhouette`, `KnifeMesh`, `MapMesher`, and the three map data tables.
Five per cent of the tree, standing in for an entire discipline.

That is not a stylistic preference, and its consequences are already load-bearing in three
places this milestone has touched:

- **`ProceduralAudio.playAnnouncer` says it outright**: *"Speech synthesis of actual lines is out
  of reach without assets and worse than nothing when it lands badly."* Ten announcer cues are
  formant-shaped noise bursts, not words. **F5 has to be read, not heard.**
- **`BotMesh`: "The mesh IS the rig: same boxes, same offsets, nothing to drift out of sync."**
  `buildZoneGeometry` walks `HUMANOID_RIG.boxes` — the same boxes `Ballistics` tests a round
  against. What you shoot is what you see, by construction rather than by discipline. **F4 is a
  proposal to break that identity**, and that is the whole of F4.

  **Round 5 executed F4 and broke it, in one direction and by a measured amount.** The paragraph
  above stands as the statement of what was at stake; what actually happened is in *"bodies, and
  the identity that had to be broken in exactly one direction"* below. The short version: the
  head and the torso are still exactly the rig and diverge by zero, the legs swing and the arms
  are posed onto the weapon, and the worst divergence is 0.412 m on a leg and 0.257 m on an arm
  — both on the two zones carrying the lowest multipliers in the game. It is measured every run
  by `npm run readability` rather than promised here. The identity is now a rule about *which*
  boxes rather than about all of them, and that is the thing a later session must not quietly
  widen.
- **F9, one session ago**, found the darkest map in the game was dark because a number in a
  *painter* was 0.019 where it should have been 0.07. With no assets there is no texture to
  inspect in an image editor; the only way to know what a surface looks like is to compute it,
  which is why `npm run readability` exists at all.

Today's client build, measured this session: **1 370.06 kB raw, 391.06 kB gzip**, plus 43.01 kB
of CSS. There is no loading screen for content because there is no content to load — §6.5's
background map build exists to hide *mesh construction*, not downloads.

## F4 — the fork in the road, and it is not a feature

"Skins and 3D models" is two different milestones wearing one sentence.

### (a) Stay procedural — skins as parameters

`CamoTextures` is the working precedent: six weapon camos, 333 lines, six *different
constructions* rather than six recolourings, each a seeded `Rng` drawing into a 256px canvas,
cached once per process. A character skin in the same idiom is a small parameter set — body,
head and gear tint, a pattern generator, maybe a silhouette accent — applied to geometry that
does not change.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | Days, not weeks. One new generator file, a `SkinId` beside `CamoId`, a picker row in the loadout editor, six or so unlock records |
| **Load time** | **Zero change.** Six 256px canvases is roughly 1.5 MiB of GPU texture, built once per process |
| **Risk** | Low, with one real edge: the hostile-body colour is taken from `ui/Palette` so it moves with colourblind mode, and a skin that painted its own colours would be a **second writer of the same fact** — the exact shape P0 bans. A skin must tint *within* the palette's answer, not around it |
| **Ceiling** | Genuinely low. Nobody will mistake it for a character model |

### (b) Build an asset pipeline — glTF, loading, caching, versioning

| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | A milestone in itself, and the loader is the smallest part of it: a cache with eviction, an asset manifest with content hashes, a CDN or a served directory, a licence audit for every model, and a build step that does not exist |
| **Load time** | This is the number that should decide it. The whole client is **391 kB gzipped** today. One rigged character with a 1k texture set is typically 2-10 MB. That is not a percentage on the download, it is a **multiplier**, and it arrives before the first frame unless a streaming path is built too |
| **What it breaks** | Everything above about the rig. A skinned mesh is not a stack of oriented boxes, so either the visual stops matching the hitboxes — which is a fairness defect, not a cosmetic one — or a second rig-to-mesh binding is built and kept honest by something that does not exist yet |
| **What else it breaks** | `npm run leak` watches heap and live subscriptions across 100 cycles. GPU resources behind an asset cache are a new class of leak it does not currently see. §8.7's 5 ms build budget is sized against *mesh construction*; a decode-and-upload pass is a different cost with a different shape |

**Recommendation: (a).** Not because (b) is wrong in principle but because of the order: (b)
spends a milestone on infrastructure whose first visible output is one character model, while
(a) reaches the same player-facing sentence — *"my operator looks different from yours"* — in
days and leaves (b) available afterwards. Route (b) also has to be taken *before* F6 rather than
after, because a map authored as data and a map authored as meshes are not the same file, and
authoring a map twice is the expensive mistake.

**Start neither until the human picks.** The two paths diverge at the first line of code.

## F16 — three new killstreaks

P4 made streaks a **currency**: `StreakLedger` holds a balance in kills, `charge` refuses what
the balance cannot cover and what has already been bought this life, and P4's measurement was
that the balance model affords **38 streaks across 705 lives where the threshold model handed out
75**. Nine streaks against three class slots is therefore a *choice* problem, not an inflation
one — the wallet still buys about one thing per life. *(Written before the cooldown pivot. The
wallet is still what bounds a purchase; what has changed is that a long life can now buy the
same thing twice, so a fourth streak competes for repeats as well as for slots.)*

Two facts from P4 that all three inherit: **no bot has ever spent a killstreak** (there is no
call site — bots bank a balance and never spend it), and **`EV.StreakEarned` has no gameplay
subscriber**, so a streak becoming affordable is announced to nobody. Three more streaks is
three more things the ten opponents will never call in and three more things nothing will
announce.

### What all three have in common, and it is new

Every shipped streak is either an **entity in the world** (sentry, care package), an **effect**
(UAV, counter-UAV, mortar) or a **camera takeover** (chopper). None of them puts a weapon in the
player's own hands while the player keeps playing. All three of F16's do, and that is the
mechanism the estimate turns on:

- **`WeaponSystem` has exactly two slots**, `primary` and `secondary`, and `equip(slotIndex,
  def)` sets one. So a streak weapon replaces the class's primary on activation and is put back
  on expiry — and the Chopper Gunner's rule applies verbatim and for the same reason: *"there is
  exactly one exit path… two things that can restore state are two things that can disagree
  about whether it has been restored."* `onExpire` is idempotent and `StreakSystem` already
  guarantees it runs on the timer, on death, on `MatchEnded`, on `dispose` and — since S8.23's
  case 4 — on the owner disconnecting.
- **`weaponIndexOf` returns 255 for anything not in `ALL_WEAPONS`.** The three synthetic streak
  weapons in `StreakWeapons.ts` are built by cloning the carbine and are not registered, which is
  correct today because nobody carries them. The moment a *player* carries one, that 255 is what
  remote clients receive in `EntitySnapshot.weaponIndex` — see "Found while here" for what it
  already costs.
- **A weapon swap the server owns has to reach the client's prediction.** P3 established the
  shape: `meta.setLoadout` re-runs the perk hooks and one of them writes
  `PlayerController.speedScale`, so a class swapped on a standing body made the client predict a
  different speed than the server — *"a constant per-tick disagreement about speed, which is what
  rubberbanding is."* A minigun that slows its carrier is exactly that, arriving mid-life with no
  spawn to hide behind.

### Minigun

| | |
|---|---|
| **Price** | 9 kills — between the sentry (8) and the chopper (12) |
| **Simulated by** | The server, through `WeaponSystem` like any other weapon. Nothing new in the damage path |
| **Wire** | `weaponIndex` only, *if* the def is registered. `MsgS.Streaks` needs no new field — `kind` is already a `u8` index into `STREAK_DEFS` and `MAX_STREAK_OFFERS` stays 3 |
| **Owner disconnects** | `onOwnerRemoved` already fires; the exit path restores the class primary to a body that is being removed anyway. **No new case** |
| **Without assets** | Cheapest of the three. `WeaponModelSpecs` builds guns from boxes and tubes; a minigun is a barrel cluster on a spin. `WeaponSilhouette` projects its killfeed glyph from the same spec for free, which is F15's payoff arriving early |
| **The real cost** | Spin-up and a movement penalty are both `speedScale`-shaped, which is the misprediction above. The chopper's belt (`chopperMagSize` / `chopperReloadSeconds`) is the precedent for bounding a held trigger without bounding the streak's length |

### Flamethrower

This is the one that does not fit the combat model, and it should be built as though it does.

`Ballistics` is hitscan with a penetration budget; `projectileSpeed` marks the only exceptions
(*"absent = hitscan. Only launchers and thrown equipment set this"*). A flame is neither.
Continuous damage has no representation anywhere: `DamageSystem.apply` is one request and one
answer, so a burn would be N small applies per tick flooding the damage-event channel, the
hitmarker and the damage numbers — and would want a `Burning` bit on an entity flags byte that
has none left (below).

**The cheap correct model is the shotgun's.** `pellets` and `pelletSpread` already resolve
several rays per trigger pull against the rig separately, and `damageFalloff` already collapses
damage with distance. A very short range, a very high rate, a wide cone and a brutal falloff is a
flamethrower's *behaviour*; the fire is presentation, which is exactly where §4.15 puts it — `Fx`
draws an additive cone with no texture, and `check:cosmetics` stays green because nothing about
it is in a snapshot.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Price** | 7 kills — the mortar's, and for the same reason: it buys a short decisive window rather than a presence |
| **Simulated by** | The server. No new damage kind if the pellet model is taken |
| **Wire** | `weaponIndex` only |
| **Owner disconnects** | The same door as the minigun |
| **Without assets** | The item that looks *best* without assets, because a flame is light rather than surface |
| **What a real burn costs instead** | A damage-over-time source, an entity flag bit that does not exist, a per-tick damage channel it would flood, and a bot question nothing answers today — `BotDirector` has no notion of "standing somewhere that hurts". Smoke blocks LOS; it does not injure |

### Riot shield and pistol — the heaviest of the three, and it is not close

The shield is **not a weapon**. The pistol half is nearly free: `equip(0, classPistol)`. The
shield half changes the hitbox model, and three facts make it the expensive one:

1. **`HitboxRig.layout` is `readonly`**, fixed at construction, and every one of the six
   construction sites passes `HUMANOID_RIG` — `Bot`, `NetPlayer`, `RemoteActor`, `Spectator`,
   `TargetDummy` and the default argument. `buildLayout` exists, so a second layout is
   anticipated; nothing swaps one.
2. **`RigHistory` stores five numbers per tick** — x, y, z, yaw, `heightScale` — and its own
   comment explains why: *"A rig is fully described by five numbers… store its history, do not
   invent a second representation."* It does **not** store which layout the rig had. A body whose
   *shape* changes during a life is therefore invisible to S4.13's lag compensation: a shot
   rewound 150 ms resolves against the shape the body has **now**, not the shape it had then.
   That is a silent hit-registration bug in the exact system M10 was spent getting right.
3. **`ColliderSet` is baked at boot and shared read-only across instances** (`MapBakery`,
   S4.19). A shield modelled as a moving world collider does not fit that structure at all.

Three ways to do it, and they are not equivalent:

| Route | What it costs | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **A second `RigLayout` with a shield box**, plus one `Uint8Array` of layout ids in `RigHistory` | `layout` stops being `readonly`; `push` / `fill` / rewind gain one field; `BotMesh` builds the shield from the same boxes, so *"the mesh is the rig"* survives intact | **Recommended.** The only route where what you shoot stays what you see |
| **A damage-side predicate** — "did this ray arrive in the front hemisphere of a shielded entity" | No geometry and no history change. But `Ballistics` has already resolved the hit by the time `DamageSystem` is asked, so the shooter gets a hitmarker for a round that did nothing — and it is a second place that decides a hit outcome | Rejected: the second-writer shape, and it lies to the shooter |
| **A moving world collider** | Honest physics, and it does not fit `ColliderSet`'s immutable shared bake | Rejected on structure |

| | |
|---|---|
| **Price** | 8 kills — the sentry's. It buys survival rather than damage |
| **Simulated by** | The server. The raise/lower state is per-entity and needs a wire bit (below) |
| **Wire** | The shape has to reach clients, or a remote shielded body both draws and rewinds wrong |
| **Owner disconnects** | The same door, and the rig must be put back to `HUMANOID_RIG` on the way out — the one restore path again |
| **Without assets** | A box. A riot shield is genuinely a slab, which is the one place this art style is not a compromise |

### The wire has no spare bits, and this is the finding to act on first

Both flag bytes are **full**, read directly:

- **`EFlag`** — `Alive`, `Firing`, `Reloading`, `Ads`, `Sprinting`, `Bot`, `Grounded`, `TeamB`.
  Eight of eight, written as `w.u8v(e.flags & 0xff)`.
- **`OF`**, the owner-state byte — `Grounded`, `WasGrounded`, `SprintActive`, `TacSprintActive`,
  `SlideActive`, `MantleActive`, `JumpedThisTick`, `JustLanded`. Eight of eight.

So *every* new per-entity boolean in this milestone — a shield raised, a grenade being cooked —
needs a field widened, and that is a protocol bump. Current version is **12**; the first wire
change in M12 is **v13**. Widen once, deliberately, rather than three times.

## F17 — the grenade animation, and where the line runs

Today there is no grenade in hand at all. `ViewmodelDrive.throwing` is one boolean derived from
`ThrowController.busy`, and `ViewmodelAnim` uses it to **lower the weapon off screen** through a
damped `throwPose`. The comment is honest about it: the throw *"used to read as the grenade
appearing from nowhere"*, and lowering the gun was the fix available at the time.

**The first-person half is free, and it is free because the simulation already holds the whole
sequence.** `ThrowController` runs on sim ticks off the input bitfield and exposes `phase`
(`IDLE` / `COOKING`), `cook` in seconds, `slot`, `followThrough` and `remainingFuse`. Pin pull,
arm cock, release and recovery are four poses keyed off values that already exist and that both
runtimes compute identically. The animation reads them; it must never write them, and it must
never keep its own clock — the fuse starts when the button goes **down**, and an animation that
decided when the hand opened would be a second authority on a timing the server owns.

That is the line, stated once: **`ThrowController` decides when the grenade leaves the hand;
`ViewmodelAnim` decides what that looks like.** Nothing new is replicated, nothing new is
recorded, and `check:cosmetics` is untouched because the snapshot is untouched.

**The third-person half splits in two, and the split is the decision:**

| What | Derivable today? |
|---|---|
| **The release**, on somebody else's body | **Yes, free.** `ProjectileState` carries `ownerId` and a `serial` that is *"already unique per throw and already stable for a projectile's whole life"*. The frame a new serial appears owned by entity N, entity N threw something. No wire change |
| **The wind-up** — pin, cock, hold | **No.** It happens entirely before the projectile exists. Nothing in the snapshot says a grenade is being cooked, and `EFlag` has no bit left to say it |

**Recommendation: take the release for nothing now**, and take the wind-up only if `EFlag` is
being widened for the riot shield anyway — one bump, two features. A wind-up also has a gameplay
consequence worth naming before it is built: seeing an enemy cook is *information*, and adding it
changes fights, which makes it a balance decision rather than an animation one.

## F6 — what a map actually costs, measured

The only item here whose cost is fully known, because three of them exist. Measured this session
— the counts from the built map defs, the bake times from a real server boot (`npm run
skirmish`), the ground luminance from `npm run readability`:

| | Foundry | Dunes | Depot | (Testbed) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Brushes | 48 | 109 | 50 | 71 |
| Prop placements | 76 | 60 | 84 | 34 |
| Spawn zones | 16 | 18 | 18 | 13 |
| Lights | 4 | 2 | 8 | 2 |
| Objectives | 6 — `flag×3 bombsite×2 bombspawn×1` | 6, identical | 6, identical | 0 |
| Lanes | 3 | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| Cover points | 220 | 164 | 172 | 72 |
| Nav layers | 2 | 2 | **3** | 2 |
| Playable area | 3 348 m² | 5 440 m² | 4 480 m² | 2 080 m² |
| Collision bake | 2.45 ms | 0.45 ms | 0.34 ms | 0.23 ms |
| **Navmesh bake** | **55.28 ms** | 19.71 ms | 26.17 ms | 7.09 ms |
| Resident | 0.37 MiB | 0.59 MiB | 0.71 MiB | 0.24 MiB |
| Source | 514 lines | 601 | 899 | 499 |
| Ground, as the screen shows it | 61.7 / 255 | 185.0 | 21.3 | — |

Four maps bake in **112.87 ms for 1.90 MiB** at boot. A fifth adds one of those rows and nothing
else on the server: `MapBakery` bakes every map in `MAPS` before the listener opens, so the cost
lands at boot rather than in a transition, by design.

**What is free and what is not:**

- **Cover points are free.** `cover.ts` derives them from prop placements and the shape's own
  profile — *"a 1 m cube is cover from every side; a container is a wall and only its long faces
  are"*. The 164-220 above were authored as 60-84 props. `navStats.coverRejected` is the data-bug
  signal on a new map and should be read before anybody plays it.
- **The navmesh is free.** *"A map therefore needs no nav authoring at all — only honest
  `navBounds`."*
- **Objectives are not free and are not optional.** `modesForMap` filters the ballot by authored
  objective kinds, so a map that skips them silently offers three modes instead of five. All
  three real maps author the identical six, and the flag positions have to be balanced *before*
  the lanes are — `types.ts` says why: moving three flags after the lanes are balanced means
  re-balancing the lanes.
- **The ballot has a ceiling of five and it is nearly reached.** `MAP_BALLOT` holds three; digits
  1-5 cast votes and are shared with the quick class selector, which takes them only while the
  ballot is hidden (round 3). A fourth map fits. A **sixth has no key**, and at five maps the
  class selector is unreachable for the whole map-vote phase.
- **The lighting bar is measurable before it is played.** `npm run readability` reports the ground
  as the screen shows it: Foundry 61.7, Dunes 185.0, Depot 21.3 — a spread of nine to one. A new
  map lands somewhere on that line, and F9's lesson is that the number to check is the **albedo in
  `albedo.ts`**, not the light intensity.
- **The client build time is the one unknown, and it is the one that matters.**
  `MapBuildQueue`'s 5 ms budget and the 20 s readiness timeout are *"one decision, not two"*,
  sized against an assumed two-second build, and the file says plainly that the measured build
  time per map *"needs a real browser"*. It has never been measured for **any** map. A fourth map
  is precisely the thing that would break that pair, and this session cannot say by how much.
  **Measure the three existing maps in a browser before authoring a fourth**, or the fourth will
  be the first data point and a timeout will be the first symptom.

Weight, from the Survival estimate this file already accepted: *"The same effort spent on a fourth
and fifth map… buys more variety per unit of risk."* That reasoning has not changed, and F6 is the
only item here with no architectural unknown in it.

## F5 — a story, honestly

**Do not assume the answer is a campaign.** Three different things hide behind the word and they
differ by two orders of magnitude.

### (a) A frame — a faction, a place, names

Nearly free, and the surfaces already exist and are already read: `ModeEntry.blurb` (six),
`GameMode.brief` (six, and F10 built the window they appear in one session ago), four map names
and blurbs, the loading screen, the summary, and the player's own default callsign — `OPERATOR`,
which is also the game's name. A frame is written into strings that are already on screen.
**Zero engineering.**

### (b) An order of battle — the opposition as characters

Bots have tiers (`RECRUIT` / `REGULAR` / `HARDENED` / `VETERAN`), a per-map authored `tierMix`,
and names already resolved through the directory the killfeed and scoreboard share. Giving the
opposing side a persistent identity across a session — a named unit, ranks that match tiers, a
roster that recurs — is small work on top of structure that exists. Medium cost, and it is the
item that would make the *existing* content feel authored rather than generated.

### (c) A campaign

The Survival estimate's argument applies without modification: a campaign is *"the first mode
that is not a variation on two teams, a score limit and a respawn rule"*. It needs mission flow
as a state, scripted triggers, objectives that are not the five modes, per-mission authoring and
a fail-and-retry loop. And then it needs dialogue — and this build **cannot speak**. Ten
announcer cues are formant-shaped noise, and the file that makes them says speech is out of reach
without assets. **A campaign in this build is a silent, text-delivered campaign**, which is a
different product from what the word suggests to whoever asked for it.

**Recommendation: (a) now, (b) with F6, not (c).** A new map that arrives with a name, a place
and an opposing unit is most of the story at a fraction of the cost, and it is the half that
survives however the F4 fork is decided.

## Dependency order

The first item unblocks the most, which is the ordering rule this file has used since Gate B.

1. **The F4 fork** — decided, not built. It gates F6: a map authored as data and a map authored
   as meshes are not the same file, and route (b) taken after F6 means authoring the map twice.
2. **F5 (a), the frame** — costs nothing and decides the names F6 and F4 then use.
3. **Measure the client map build in a browser** — the §8.7 number open since M11, and the one
   F6 cannot be sized without.
4. **F6, map four** — the highest player-hours per unit of risk, and the only item with no
   architectural unknown.
5. **The `EFlag` widening (protocol v13)** — one bump, taken deliberately, because F16 and F17
   both need bits and neither can have one.
6. **F17** — release-only third person costs nothing; the wind-up rides v13.
7. **F16, in this order: minigun → flamethrower → riot shield.** The minigun establishes the
   streak-carries-a-weapon path — equip, restore, the one exit, the prediction question. The
   flamethrower reuses it plus the shotgun's pellet model. The shield goes last because it is the
   only one that touches lag compensation, and it should not be built on a path that is still
   moving.
8. **F4, as (a)** — genuinely last, and the only item that can be deferred indefinitely with no
   loss to anything else.

## What each item breaks

| Item | What it puts at risk |
|---|---|
| F4 (a) | The palette's single authority over team colour — a skin that paints its own is a second writer, and `npm run readability`'s 12-pair colour invariant is the probe that would have to grow to cover it |
| F4 (b) | *"The mesh is the rig."* Hit registration stops being verifiable by looking. Plus a leak class the 100-cycle harness does not watch, and a download budget currently at 391 kB gzip |
| F16 minigun | Prediction: a server-owned weapon swap mid-life, with a movement penalty, is P3's `speedScale` rubberband with no spawn to hide behind |
| F16 flamethrower | The damage path, if a real burn is chosen over the pellet cone |
| F16 riot shield | S4.13 lag compensation. A body whose shape changes during a life rewinds to the wrong shape, silently |
| F17 | Nothing, if the animation reads `ThrowController` and never writes it. A second clock over the fuse would be the banned shape exactly |
| F6 | The §8.7 budget/timeout pair, and the ballot's five-key ceiling |
| F5 (a)/(b) | Nothing |
| F5 (c) | Everything Survival would have broken, and it ships mute |

## Decisions waiting on the human

Each with a recommendation, and none of them started.

| # | Decision | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **F4: procedural parameters, or an asset pipeline?** | **Procedural.** (b) spends a milestone on infrastructure to ship one model, and breaks the mesh-is-the-rig identity |
| 2 | **Are the three streak weapons registered in `ALL_WEAPONS`?** | **Yes**, with an unreachable `unlockLevel`. It is what makes `weaponIndex`, the killfeed glyph and the silhouette work with no parallel table. It moves `check:unlocks`'s count off 12 weapons and will want unlock records |
| 3 | **`EFlag` is full. Widen to 16 bits, or go without?** | **Widen, once, as v13.** The shield's raise state and the throw wind-up both need a bit and neither can be derived |
| 4 | **Flamethrower: pellet cone, or a real burn?** | **Pellet cone.** It reuses the shotgun's machinery and adds no damage kind, no flag bit and no bot question |
| 5 | **Riot shield hitbox: second `RigLayout`, damage predicate, or moving collider?** | **Second layout**, plus one array in `RigHistory`. The only route where what you shoot stays what you see |
| 6 | **Are the new streaks unlock-gated?** | **No.** All six shipped ones are ungated; gating three of nine makes the picker inconsistent for no gain |
| 7 | **Prices: minigun / flamethrower / shield** | **9 / 7 / 8.** P4 measured the balance model at 38 streaks per 705 lives, so nine streaks over three slots is a choice problem rather than inflation. These are a starting point for the human to feel, not a result |
| 8 | **F17 third person: release only, or wind-up too?** | **Release now** — free, off `ProjectileState.ownerId`. Wind-up only alongside #3, and note that it is a balance change rather than an animation |
| 9 | **Does map four author all six objectives?** | **Yes.** Otherwise `modesForMap` silently offers three modes instead of five, and flags moved later mean lanes re-balanced later |
| 10 | **F5 scope** | **Frame now, order of battle with F6, no campaign.** A campaign here ships mute |

## Measured, this session

Every number in this section came out of a run in this session, named with the probe that
produced it. No product code was written, so there is nothing here to regress; the gate was run
to confirm the tree was clean before the documentation commit.

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| Asset-file census — `find src public index.html` over 17 image/model/audio/font extensions | **0 files.** 296 `.ts`, 5 `.css`, 101 369 lines |
| Procedural generators, `wc -l` over the sixteen files | **5 118 lines** — 5.0% of the tree |
| `npm run build` — client bundle | **1 370.06 kB raw / 391.06 kB gzip**, CSS 43.01 kB |
| `npm run skirmish` — boot bake, four maps | **112.87 ms / 1.90 MiB**; Foundry navmesh **55.28 ms**, Dunes 19.71, Depot 26.17, Testbed 7.09 |
| Map defs at runtime — brushes / props / spawns / cover / objectives / lanes | the F6 table above |
| `npm run readability` — ground as the screen shows it | Foundry **61.7**, Dunes **185.0**, Depot **21.3** of 255 |
| `npm run check` | boundaries, cosmetics (**19 snapshot fields**), unlocks (**12 weapons, 12 perks, 4 field upgrades, 5 equipment, 6 camos, 6 requirement accessors**), cheats (**6 codes, 5 entitlement bits**) and all three typecheck targets pass |

Read by inspection rather than measured, and named as such because they are the load-bearing
claims above: `EFlag` and `OF` each assign 8 of 8 bits; `HitboxRig.layout` is `readonly` and
`RigHistory` stores five per-tick fields with no layout among them; `WeaponSystem` has two slots;
`weaponIndexOf` returns 255 for any id outside `ALL_WEAPONS`; `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 12.

## Needs a browser

This session drew no pixels and claims none. Two items below are prerequisites rather than
checks — they are inputs to decisions above, not verifications of them:

- **The client map build time, per map** (§8.7, open since M11). Load each of Foundry, Dunes and
  Depot from the arena and read `BuildReport` — `elapsedMs`, `workMs`, `chunks`, `worstChunkMs`,
  `frames`. **F6 cannot be sized without this**, and if any map costs materially more than two
  seconds of work then `DEFAULT_BUDGET_MS` (5) and `READY_TIMEOUT_MS` (20 s) both move, together.
- **Depot at 21.3 counts**, still on P9's list. If the yard still reads as black after the albedo
  change, the next lever is the irradiance floor rather than the albedo — and that answer changes
  how a fourth map should be lit before it is authored.

Everything else on the earlier browser lists is unchanged; this session neither added to them nor
removed from them.

## Found while here

- **Killstreak kills have no icon of their own, in either runtime, and F16 would add three more.**
  `DamageSystem` emits `EV.EntityKilled` with `weaponId = def.id`, so a sentry kill carries
  `streak_sentry`. Solo, `iconFor('streak_sentry')` reaches `modelSpecFor`, which returns
  `WEAPON_MODEL_SPECS[id] ?? AR_BASE` — so the feed draws a **carbine** for a kill by a turret.
  Over the network it is worse in a way that matters for the fix: `EventCollector` writes
  `weaponIndexOf('streak_sentry')`, which is **255** because the synthetic defs are deliberately
  not in `ALL_WEAPONS`, and `NetSession` decodes it back as `weaponIdAt(255) ?? ''` — so the
  client is handed an empty string and the id is gone. The two runtimes therefore need different
  fixes: solo has the information and lacks a spec, networked lacks the information. Not this
  session's item and nobody reported it, but decision #2 above is exactly the lever that would
  close both halves at once.
- **The milestone status table at the top of this file is stale** — it lists milestones 10 and 11
  as "Planned" while M11 Gate B is part-done and four playtest rounds have landed on top of it.
  Left alone deliberately: correcting it is a claim about what is complete, and Gate B's own
  "What Gate B still needs" list is the honest answer to that question rather than a table row. (2026-09-14: the table is gone — the header now carries an index of the archived sections and makes no completion claim, for this reason.)

*The playtest round 4 and round 5 fix records that followed this section are in [19-m12-playtest-rounds-4-5-fixes.md](docs/archive/plan/19-m12-playtest-rounds-4-5-fixes.md).*

# Milestone 18 — the debrief: the result, the podium, the XP, and the board on a tab

Opened 2026-09-20 from the human's brief in chat, with two reference images (a result card —
VICTORY over two team plates, a match summary and an XP bar — and a two-column scoreboard with
an awards row) and three playtest reports. The plan was described to the human before any code
was written and built after their answers, which are the decisions below. Everything here was
built in the session that opened it; what remains is the human's playtest.

## The brief, as read

The end-of-match screen as *two screens in one*. **The first** opens on the result card: how
much each side made, against whom, on which map, how much XP was earned. Then the team plates
rise and go, the word shrinks to the top, the map card drops and goes, the XP stays at the
foot — and the best players of the match come in, stand on a podium (gold, silver, bronze;
MVP on the first) and their statistics rise under them. PLAY AGAIN and a way back to the menu
at the side. **The second** is the full board: score, kills, deaths, assists for everybody on
both sides, the reference's second image. Space is PLAY AGAIN. And the second button is *not*
"return to lobby" — in multiplayer PLAY AGAIN already is the lobby — it returns to the main
menu, under another name.

The three reports: Play Solo has no way back; the intro's overview stands beside the map rather
than over it; the device gate on a phone is small and cluttered.

## Decisions taken (2026-09-20, the human's answers)

1. **Three on the podium, from the whole match.** Gold, silver and bronze are a set of three,
   and the podium ranks individuals: the ladder's top three whichever side they were on, the
   crowned winner pinned first where a mode crowns one. A hostile MVP on a DEFEAT screen says
   what happened. (It was the winning side's five; `Lineup.ts` now says why.)
2. **The board is a tab.** PODIUM | SCOREBOARD in the head, and Tab turns it, as in a match.
   Never automatic: the podium is the moment.
3. **PLAY AGAIN restarts the same match in single-player** — map, mode, difficulty as they
   stand. Connected it reads NEXT MATCH with the server's countdown, because the server runs
   the ballot and the rotation and there is no "again" to give.
4. **MAIN MENU** is the secondary's name, with the arrow BACK carries elsewhere. Offered in
   single-player too, now that the primary no longer goes there.
5. **AFTER ACTION REPORT** names the place in the header, with the mode and the map under it
   — which is also where the map's name stays once the mission card has left.
6. **The XP accordion stays**, and the cadence starts when the podium has landed. It does not
   open on its own here (D2's rule): the list would open over the stat cards. The strip
   says how many unlocks it holds and a click opens it.
7. **No team emblems.** ALLIES and AXIS as the board names them, in their colours. The human
   may add two static logo assets later; the plates have the place for them.
8. **The keys arm a second in.** Space, Escape and Tab mean nothing for the first second —
   the hand still holding jump, the Escape aimed at the pause menu — and any other key or a
   click on nothing skips the choreography to its rest.
9. **The score stays with the word.** When the plates lift, `75 — 62` docks beside VICTORY in
   the head rather than leaving with them.
10. **Sharp motion, no bounce.** One ease, decisive.
11. **The hold is thirty seconds, not fourteen.** The human's change to the plan: the
    choreography is not to be squeezed into five seconds; it has ten, and twenty remain for the
    board. `SUMMARY_HOLD_SECONDS` defaults to 30 (README, DEPLOY.md).
12. **The gate's copy is two lines**, the human's own: *PROTOCOL SEVEN is a desktop shooter* ·
    *Open it on a computer.*

## What was built

### The three fixes (commit `aa1ef08`)

- **Play Solo**: BACK at the action bar's left end, Settings' button in Settings' place, and
  Escape is the same press (`Menus.handleEscape`).
- **The intro's overview** (`IntroPlan.ts`): the heading eases once, with the climb, from the
  approach's onto the map's centre — a heading that held while the ray turned put the camera
  beside the map looking past it. Measured before: 30° to 150° off-axis on twelve of
  Foundry's sixteen spawns and six of Depot's eighteen. After: every spawn within 1°. The
  fan now prefers the *smallest* turn that clears, in two bands — up to 60° at every
  elevation before anything wider at any — so Foundry B's spawns take 36° straight back over
  45° from across the map, and the largest turn left on any map is 60°. `npm run intro` green.
- **The device gate** off the frame's scale: `op-screen--gate` takes the zoom off its viewport
  and the screen is laid out in window pixels as a portrait column — the lockup at two thirds
  of the width, the two lines, FIGHT · SURVIVE · WIN at the foot.

### The debrief (`EndOfMatch.ts`, rewritten; `app.css` `.dbf`)

The shared chrome, then three rows in the frame: the head (64), the body (694), the band
(84). The choreography runs on the render clock (`tick`), one class per phase on the frame,
the staggers inside a phase as `transition-delay`s in the stylesheet:

| at | phase | what |
|---|---|---|
| 0.0 | `dbf--card` | the word lands (a hit), the reason, the plates in from the sides with VS, the mission card up, the band |
| 4.2 | `dbf--dock` | the plates lift and fade, the card drops, the word is FLIPped onto the head's box; a sweep |
| 4.8 | `dbf--docked` | the head takes over: the small word, the score, the reason, the tabs |
| 4.9 | `dbf--podium` | the stage fades in; bronze, silver, gold walk onto their blocks, 0.3 s apart |
| 7.0 | `dbf--plates` | the medal and the name under each, bronze first, a note each |
| 7.6 | `dbf--stats` | the stat cards: score, kills, deaths, K/D |
| 8.2 | `dbf--rest` | the XP cadence starts |

`settle` is the skip and the layout probe's: every phase at once, the transitions off for
the frame it takes, the bodies on their marks, the cadence started. `settleCard` holds the
card alone for the probe's `summary/card`.

- **The podium** is `CharacterStage` with a new platform (`PODIUM_STAGE`): three blocks at
  `PODIUM_X` and `PODIUM_STEPS` (`Lineup.ts`, pure, tested), the lens tilted down so the feet
  land in the upper two thirds of the canvas and the plates hang in the lower third.
  `walkIn` puts each body 3.2 m behind its block and moves it onto the mark at 2.4 m/s; the
  avatar reads its own planar speed and its selector answers with the walk clip, so the walk
  is the same walk a bot walks. A body is invisible until its turn.
- **The board tab** is the same `Scoreboard`, each side a plate with its name on the top edge
  in its colour, and an awards row under it: MVP, BEST K/D, MOST ASSISTS, LONGEST STREAK.
- **The header's card follows the bar**: `XpSummary.onLevel` → `EndOfMatch.setShownLevel`,
  so LEVEL 55 beside the callsign flips with the flourish rather than before it.
  `XpSummary.prime` paints the strip before the cadence so it reads from the first second.
- **Three cues** in `ProceduralAudio`: `playDebriefHit` (the splash's hit with a bright
  partial on a win), `playDebriefSweep` (the dock), `playDebriefMedal` (523 / 659 / 784 Hz
  as bronze, silver, gold land — a chord, the gold's with a second partial).
- **PLAY AGAIN in single-player**: `Game.leaveSummary` tears the world down and enters MATCH,
  which builds a fresh one on the same selection — a fresh intro, deck and seed.
- **Edge cases**: Free-for-All's plates are the winner and the runner-up with their kills; a
  draw's podium is the ladder's top three under DRAW; the Range has no summary, as before.

### Verified

`npm run check` (150 tests, the podium's among them), `npm run layout` (every surface at six
viewports, the debrief at `summary/card`, `summary/{2,6,10}`, `/xp`, `/board`, `/ffa`), and the
screen driven end to end in the browser pane: the choreography, Tab, the click that skips,
Space into a new match, Escape to the menu.

## Open

- **The human's playtest**, with sound.
- **Team emblems** (decision 7): if two assets arrive, they go on the plates and the board's
  headings, tinted by `ui/Palette`'s relation colours rather than painted — a second writer
  of the friendly/hostile fact is the shape P0 bans.
