/**
 * Authoring helpers for the map DSL.
 *
 * M1's grey-box room built its brushes with a local `add` closure and worked out its two
 * ramps by hand. Foundry has nine pitched surfaces and is rotationally symmetric, so both
 * jobs are worth doing once, properly, where a second map can use them.
 *
 * Two rules are encoded here rather than left to the author:
 *
 * **A ramp is defined by the two ends of its walking surface**, not by an angle and an
 * offset. `rampAlongX(out, m, x0, y0, x1, y1, ...)` produces a pitched box whose top face
 * passes exactly through both points, which is what stops a 2 cm lip at the bottom of a
 * ramp — a lip that is a movement bug, not a cosmetic one.
 *
 * **Rotational symmetry is applied, not retyped.** `rotateHalf` maps a placement through
 * 180 degrees about the origin: `(x, z) -> (-x, -z)`, `yaw -> yaw + pi`. Authoring one
 * outer lane and rotating it is the only way to be *certain* the two are equally fair,
 * and it halves what there is to get wrong. It is deliberately restricted to yaw-only
 * brushes: the collider basis composes as `Rz * Rx * Ry` (see `ColliderSet.writeBasis`),
 * so adding pi to `rotationY` is a world-space rotation for a yaw-only brush and is *not*
 * one for a pitched brush. Ramps are authored per side through the helpers above, which is
 * why `rotateHalf` throws rather than silently producing a ramp pointing into the floor.
