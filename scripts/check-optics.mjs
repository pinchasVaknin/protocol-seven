/**
 * The optic audit (playtest round 4, B2 and its regression).
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * **A weapon modelled with `optic: 'scope'` must have a `scope` block in its `WeaponDef`.**
 *
 * Those two facts live in different partitions and drive different machinery, and nothing
 * connected them:
 *
 *   `WeaponModelSpec.optic`  (client)  decides the *geometry* — a 12-sided tube whose axis is
 *                                      `sightHeight`, which is the line `ViewmodelAnim.adsY`
 *                                      puts on the centre of the screen when the player aims.
 *   `WeaponDef.scope`        (shared)  decides the *hand-off* — above `SCOPE_VIEWMODEL_HIDDEN`
 *                                      the viewmodel is hidden and `HudTactical` draws the
 *                                      scope picture instead.
 *
 * With the first set and the second absent, aiming puts a solid tube on the sight line and
 * nothing takes it away. That was `ar_longbow`, reported as *"the crosshair is closed on one
 * particular AR"*, and it was exactly one weapon because it was the only disagreement.
 *
 * ## Why this is a check and not a comment
 *
 * The first fix opened the tube's ends so the eye could see through it, which traded a blocked
 * sight for a hollow one: an open cylinder is single-sided, so at hip fire — where the camera is
 * behind the weapon looking along it — all three scoped weapons read as a trough with the
 * reticle floating inside. Two playtests in a row reported a consequence of the same mismatch.
 *
 * A rule a human has to remember is a rule that will be broken, which is the argument
 * `check-boundaries` and `check-unlocks` are already built on. This is cheap, it runs in the
 * gate, and it fails by name.
 *
 * ## Limits, stated rather than assumed
 *
 * It reads sources with regular expressions, exactly as `check-cosmetics` and `check-unlocks`
 * do. It knows a spec *names* `optic: 'scope'` and that a def *has* a `scope:` block; it does
 * not know what either renders. What is on the screen is a browser claim and stays on that list.

 * `defs/`. That was invisible to this audit until a streak weapon wanted a model spec of its
 * own — the shield-pistol, which really is a pistol and looks absurd wearing the carbine's
 * fallback — and the audit correctly refused an id it could not find a def for.
 *
 * The rule below is unchanged and still applies to them: a spec modelled with `optic: 'scope'`
 * needs a def that scopes. None of these do, and none may, which is exactly what makes them
 * safe to enumerate by id here rather than by parsing a builder.
