/**
 * Create-a-Class (brief S6.3).
 *
 * Five slots, each holding a primary with attachments, a secondary, a lethal, a tactical,
 * three perks — one per tier — and a field upgrade. The record below is what the save file
 * stores and what the editor writes; nothing about it is derived, so a loadout survives a
 * schema change as long as the ids do.
 *
 * **`resolveLoadout` is the whole point of the file.** It turns a slot into the two
 * `WeaponDef`s the player will actually hold, and it does it through
 * `resolveWeaponDef` — the same pure function M5's gameplay uses, now taking the perks'
 * modifiers alongside the attachments. The loadout editor calls this per keystroke and
 * `Game.buildWorld` calls it once a match; both get the same numbers because there is only
 * one place they can come from. That is acceptance criterion 3, and it is a property of
 * the code rather than a claim about it.

/**
 * The five shipped classes.
 *
 * **Everything here is legal on a fresh level-1 profile**, and that constraint used to
 * decide the whole table rather than merely bound it: until playtest round 5 the level-1
 * arsenal was one primary, so all five slots named the carbine and differed only in
 * whether they took the two perks available at level 1. That is what F10 reported — five
 * classes and one class — and the fix is upstream of this file. Three primaries open at
 * level 1 now (see `Unlocks.ts` for the principle and `npm run progression` for the
 * assertion), so there is finally something for five slots to disagree about.
 *
 * The constraint itself has not moved. A default that named a locked weapon would be
 * silently rewritten by `sanitiseLoadout` on first load, and a rewritten default is
 * indistinguishable from a bug; the probe runs `sanitiseLoadout` over all five and fails
 * if it changes anything.
 *
 * **Two names still share the carbine, and it is the same reason as before, narrowed.**
 * SUPPORT wants an LMG and MARKSMAN wants a sniper, and those are the two archetypes the
 * ladder deliberately holds back — the BASTION at 15 and the KESTREL at 11. Both fall back
 * to the carbine because it is the only level-1 primary that holds a fight past 15 m
 * (`docs/BALANCE.md`'s band table), and both become themselves when the ladder pays out.
 * What separates them meanwhile is what a level-1 profile can actually vary: the two
 * available perks and the streak trio.
