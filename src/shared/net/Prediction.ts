/**
 * Client-side prediction and reconciliation (M10, S4.11 and S6.3).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * S4.11: *"Client prediction is mandatory, not a polish item. Without it every input carries
 * a full round trip and the movement feel built in M1 is destroyed."* At 100 ms RTT, waiting
 * for the server before moving means the player presses W and the world responds a tenth of a
 * second later, forever. Every good thing about M1's movement — the slide, the mantle, the
 * tac-sprint double tap — depends on the response being immediate.
 *
 * So the client runs `PlayerController.step(cmd)` on its own command the instant it samples
 * it, and remembers what it predicted.
 *
 * ## Reconciliation, exactly
 *
 * The server acks the last `seq` it processed and sends the authoritative state at that
 * moment. Then:
 *
 * 1. Find the prediction recorded for that `seq`.
 * 2. Compare. Within epsilon, the prediction was right: **do nothing at all.**
 * 3. Beyond epsilon, load the authoritative state and replay every command after that `seq`
 *    through the same `PlayerController.step` the server ran.
 *
 * Step 2 is the one that matters most and the one most easily got wrong. A client that snaps
 * to the authoritative state on *every* update — even a matching one — throws away the
 * prediction it correctly made for the ticks the server has not seen yet, and the player
 * rubberbands on a working connection.
 *
 * ## Why replay reproduces the server exactly
 *
 * Because `step` is a pure function of `(state, command)`, and the two impurities that were
 * not are fixed: `WeaponSystem`'s spread stream is now seeded per event from
 * `(tickIndex, entityId, shotIndex)` (S4.14), and the cosmetic events `step` emits are
 * suppressed during a replay — see `replaying`. Without the first, every replayed shot
 * diverges. Without the second, replaying eight commands plays eight footsteps.
 *
 * ## Smoothing
 *
 * S4.11: *"Corrections are applied smoothly over several ticks. A hard snap is what players
 * call rubberbanding."* The correction is applied to the *simulation* immediately — it has
 * to be, or the next tick computes from a position the server has rejected — and the
 * difference is carried as a decaying **visual** offset that the camera adds. The player's
 * collision, their shots and their position are authoritative at once; only what they see
 * eases across. See `CORRECTION_SMOOTHING_TICKS`.
 *
 * ## What is replayed, and what deliberately is not
 *
 * **Movement is replayed. The weapon is not.**
 *
 * `WeaponSystem.step` has effects that are not part of `PlayerSimState` and must not happen
 * twice: it consumes ammunition, advances the reload timer and fires rounds. Replaying eight
 * commands through it would empty a magazine eight times as fast and emit eight duplicate
 * shots. So the weapon runs exactly once per real tick, and its authoritative state — ammo,
 * reload, equipped slot — arrives replicated in the snapshot.
 *
 * This does not cause the movement replay to diverge, and the reason is worth stating because
 * it is not obvious: recoil affects aim, and aim affects movement direction. But recoil's
 * unrecovered residual is folded into the player's *view angles*, which are sampled into the
 * next `InputCommand` as absolute yaw and pitch — so a replayed command already carries the
 * post-recoil aim it was sampled with. The replay reproduces the server exactly because the
 * angles are data in the command rather than state in the weapon.
 *
 * The weapon's weight is the one thing it did leave behind (2026-09-28): a body moves at the
 * speed of what it is holding, which is weapon state. So each record keeps the
 * `weaponSpeedScale` its command was stepped with, and the replay steps with that — data beside
 * the command, for the same reason the angles are data in it.
 */

/**
 * How far the prediction may be from the authoritative state before it counts as wrong.
 *
 * One millimetre. Deliberately tiny rather than forgiving: S8.4 requires the misprediction
 * count to be **zero** at zero added latency, and that is only a meaningful test if the
 * threshold is tight enough that a real divergence cannot hide under it. The owner state is
 * sent at full `f32` precision precisely so this can be this small — with the 1 cm
 * quantisation used for remote entities, an epsilon below a centimetre would be permanently
 * tripped by rounding and the count could never be zero.
