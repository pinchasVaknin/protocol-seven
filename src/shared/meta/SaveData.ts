/**
 * The save file (brief S6.6), and the migration that must never cost anybody their unlocks.
 *
 * S6.6 is blunt about the stakes: *"Losing a player's progress because you bumped a schema
 * is the worst bug in this milestone."* So there are two separate mechanisms here and they
 * do different jobs.
 *
 * **`migrateSave`** handles a *version* change: a payload written by an older schema is
 * translated field by field into the current one. `SaveStore` calls it once, at load.
 *
 * **`normaliseSave`** handles *damage*: a payload at the right version whose contents are
 * wrong — a weapon id that no longer exists, a level that disagrees with the XP, a perk in
 * the wrong tier, `null` where an object should be, a hand-edited save trying to equip a
 * locked weapon. It runs on **every** load, not only on a version change, and it repairs
 * in place and returns a list of what it had to touch. Nothing is ever discarded silently
 * and the whole file is never reset because one field was bad — which is the difference
 * between this and `try { JSON.parse } catch { reset }`.
 *
 * Both are pure functions over plain data with no DOM and no storage access, which is what
 * lets `verify/progression.js` hand them a hand-written older save and check the result.
 */

 * because it is the settings block of save **v2**; the version lives on the save, not on
 * each block, and renaming the type would have been a rename with no migration behind it.

 * The v4 bump (M15, B5) is the M8 kind: `normaliseSave` would default `settings.skin` without
