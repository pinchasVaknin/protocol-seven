/**
 * Weapon data (brief S6.1). Plain objects, no subclass per weapon.
 *
 * M2 said "M5 adds eleven more entries to this file and writes no new classes to do it".
 * That held: the eleven new weapons are data, and the only new *code* in M5's weapon layer
 * is the pellet loop, the scope, the swap and the attachment resolver — none of which is a
 * subclass and all of which are driven from the fields below.
 *
 * The data itself moved to `defs/`, one file per class, because twelve authored recoil
 * patterns is four hundred lines of content on its own. This file is the schema, the
 * registry and the helpers.
 *
 * Angles are in degrees throughout, because that is the unit these get tuned in.
 * Conversion happens once, at the point of use.
 *
 * The debug panel's slider metadata and accessors live in `WeaponTuning.ts`, derived from
 * these types rather than hand-listed alongside them.
