 * The wire contract, defined once and compiled by both sides (M10, S6.1).

 */

/**
 * Bump on any layout change to any message in this file.
 *
 * v18 (M16, B6): **the body other players see.** `EntitySnapshot` gains `characterIndex` — a
 * position in `SKIN_IDS`, or 255 for "declared none" — under its own delta bit, on every full
 * write; `Hello` gains the same byte after the name, sent by every connection with no presence
 * byte. Until this, a player's skin (M15 B5) was local-first: their own stage and lineup showed
 * the pick and every other client dealt them a body from a shuffled deck, so two clients
 * showed the same player as two people. The server has no opinion about a bot's body and
 * writes 255; the client's deck is the fallback for that, as it was the rule for everybody.
 * `heightScale`, redundant since M13 C2 and waiting for a bump, deliberately stays in this one
 * (M16 decision 1): one change per bump is one thing to bisect.
 *
 * v17 (M13 Phase B, bug 4.3): the **scoreboard is state** — `MsgS.Scoreboard`, the whole row
 * set, sent to a seat when it is seated and whenever the set has changed since that seat last
 * saw it, rate-limited and with a periodic full resend under loss.
 *
 * A client's board was built out of replicated events, so a player who joined or returned
 * mid-match read zeros for everybody and a player who returned after the grace stood beside
 * their own old row. The set on the wire *is* the authority: a row it carries is upserted, a
 * row it does not is removed. Every column the modes can draw rides it, so the accuracy and
 * damage figures a client used to derive from `FiredEvent` are the server's too.
 *
 * v16 (M13 Phase A, bug 4.4): `MsgS.Summary` carries the **winning entity** beside the winning
 * side.
 *
 * Free-for-All decides on one row and could only report that row's substrate side, so every
 * client on the winner's side — half the lobby — read VICTORY. Two bytes, `-1` where no
 * individual won, and the summary screen decides VICTORY or a place per recipient from it.
 *
 * v15 (M11 Gate B, playtest round 5, F9): `KilledEvent` carries the killer's **remaining health
 * at the instant of the kill**.
 *
 * The death screen names nobody, and F9 asks it to carry what a player can act on next time —
 * of which the killer's remaining health is the one that changes behaviour. Every entity's
 * health is already replicated in the snapshot, so a client can produce *a* number without this
 * byte; it would be a number from a frame up to a tick and an interpolation delay old, possibly
 * already carrying damage the killer took afterwards. That is a different fact with the same
 * name, which is this milestone's recurring failure, and it is not worth repeating to save one
 * byte on an event that happens a few times a minute.
 *
 * v14 (M11 Gate B, playtest round 5, B5): `FiredEvent` carries **how many of the pull's rays
 * connected** where it carried a "did anything connect" bit.
 *
 * A client builds its own scoreboard out of replicated events — there is no scoreboard on the
 * wire — so the accuracy column for every remote player is computed from this event. A bit
 * makes a shotgun's eight rays into one shot that either landed or did not, so the client
 * counted trigger pulls while the server counted rounds: the same figure with two definitions,
 * split by runtime. The count is six spare bits of the byte the tracer flag already rides, and
 * the *denominator* is not on the wire at all — it is `WEAPON_DEFS[weaponIndex].pellets`, which
 * both sides compile against.
 *
 * v13 (M11 Gate B, playtest round 4, the killstreak pivot): each offer in `MsgS.Streaks` carries
 * a **lockout in centiseconds** where it carried a "used this life" bit.
 *
 * Once-per-life was replaced by a per-streak cooldown that runs from the moment the streak's
 * effect ends, plus a refusal while the player's own previous instance is still in the world. A
 * boolean cannot express either: the client has to know *how long*, because the strip draws the
 * wait as a fill, and it has to be the server's number, because the clock is the simulation's
 * tick and the client is not running it. One byte per offer became two and the bit went away.
 *
 * v12 (M11 Gate B, playtest round 4): **cheat codes** (F14). `MsgC.Cheat` carries the text a
 * player typed and `MsgS.Cheats` carries what the server decided about it; the resulting
 * entitlement mask rides the **owner block** of every snapshot.
 *
 * The mask is in the snapshot rather than only in the reply because it is *state* and not an
 * edge. Two of the three simulation entitlements are invisible to a client that has the wrong
 * answer, and the third — noclip — is a permanent misprediction: the server would fly a body the
 * client keeps in collision, for the rest of the match, if the one reply carrying it were
 * dropped. Repeated every snapshot there is nothing to lose. Same reasoning as P5's spawn serial:
 * *a serial is still true on the tenth snapshot after the spawn.*
 *
 * v11 (M11 Gate B, playtest round 4): a **reconnect token** in both directions. The seat
 * assignment carries one out, and `Hello` carries one back.
 *
 * F8 asks for a returning player to get their seat back, and the only thing a `Hello` used to
 * carry was a name and a class — neither of which identifies anybody. A name is not an identity
 * (two players may share one, and anybody may claim yours), so the server has to hand out
 * something unguessable and recognise it on the way back in. See `RECONNECT_TOKEN_BYTES`.
 *
 * v10 (M11 Gate B, playtest round 4): `MsgS.Streaks` carries a **price list** instead of an
 * inventory — each equipped streak's kind, what it costs this player after Hardline, and
 * whether they have already bought it this life — plus the kill **balance** in place of the
 * consecutive-kill count.
 *
 * B9 turned killstreaks from thresholds into a currency, and a currency cannot be replicated as
 * a list of things you are allowed to press: the client has to know what a press will cost, and
 * why a key that does nothing did nothing. Both facts are the server's, because both are per
 * life and one of them carries a perk.
 *
 * v9 (M11 Gate B, playtest round 4): `MsgS.Summary` carries the tick the hold **ends on**
 * instead of how many seconds it lasts.
 *
 * A duration is only true at the instant it is sent, and the summary screen's countdown was the
 * one place in the client still integrating a local `dt` against a server deadline. It is now
 * the same derivation the vote overlay has always used.
 *
 * v2: the snapshot header gained match phase, phase seconds and round (M10 playtest fix).
 * The HUD reads those off the client's own `MatchFlow`, which on a dedicated server never
 * ticks — so without them the banner and the clock showed their construction-time values for
 * the whole match.
 */
/**
 * v8 (M11 Gate B): `MsgS.StateHash` — the §7 divergence checker's wire.
 *
 * v7 (M11 Gate B): grenades cross the wire — `MsgS.Projectiles`.
 *
 * The server has thrown and detonated equipment since the previous commit and no client could
 * see any of it: a grenade from a bot or another player damaged people while being invisible.
 *
 * v6 (M11 Gate B): killstreaks cross the wire — `MsgC.Streak` and `MsgS.Streaks`.
 *
 * The server has run `StreakSystem` since the previous commit and no client could see or spend
 * anything it produced. `Streaks` is the protocol's first genuinely per-recipient message: earn
 * state is private to a player and UAV contacts are private to a team.
 *
 * v5 (M11 Gate B): the rest of the mode state — Kill Confirmed's tags and S&D's bomb.
 *
 * v4's objective channel fixed Domination and left the same hole open in two other modes, for
 * the same root cause: every one of these lives behind `MatchFlow.simulate`, which a networked
 * client does not run. Domination's flags were merely *stale*; a networked Kill Confirmed had
 * no tags on the floor at all and a networked S&D had a fuse that never counted.
 *
 * v4 (M11 Gate B): objective state replication.
 *
 * v3 (M11): the skirmish flow. Five new messages in each direction's id space, and `Welcome`
 * grew an instance id and a migration tick — a client that cannot tell which instance a
 * snapshot describes will apply a live match's world to its warmup arena.
