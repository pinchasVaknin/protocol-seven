/**
 * One match's worth of progression, accumulated in memory and banked once at the end.
 *
 * The counting is `MatchLedger` (M13 Phase B) — the same ledger a dedicated server keeps per
 * seat — composed here for the local player, with the two things only a client has: a
 * `ChallengeTracker` fed every described kill, and a `ProgressionStore` the whole match is
 * folded into exactly once, from `finish`. Nothing here writes to storage before that,
 * allocates per event, or can change what a match does.
 *
 * **Subscription order is load-bearing.** `MatchFlow` subscribes to `entity.killed` in
 * `Match`'s constructor and the ledger subscribes after it, so by the time its handler runs
 * the mode has already called `ScoreSystem.recordKill` and the streak read out of the score
 * row is the streak *including* this kill. `EventBus` dispatches in subscription order, and
 * that is what keeps the streak a single tally rather than a private copy that could drift.
