/**
 * MP_DEPOT — the second M8 map (brief S6.2).
 *
 * A cargo yard at night. **Verticality is the identity**: a good deal of the useful ground
 * on this map is off the ground, and the difference between Depot and the other two is that
 * you spend a match looking up as often as along.
 *
 * ## Three heights, and the rule that generated them
 *
 * ```
 *   5.26   the gantry bridge across the middle of the yard
 *   5.20   the trim cap on top of a two-high container stack
 *   5.14   the walking surface of a two-high container stack
 *   2.60   container roofs — the level the map is actually fought on
 *   0.00   the yard
 * ```
 *
 * Every step between them is **at or under `mantleMaxHeight` (1.6 m)**, which is not a
 * stylistic choice — it is the only rule that makes a height reachable at all. A container
 * roof is 2.6 m and cannot be mantled from the yard, so every stack that is meant to be
 * climbable carries a foot: a `pallets` at 0.9 m and a `crateTall` at 1.5 m against its
 * long face, giving 0 -> 1.5 -> 2.6. On a two-high stack a second `crateTall` sits on the
 * lower roof for 2.6 -> 4.1 -> 5.14. The two gantry stairs are the nav-legal alternative
 * for anyone, bot or player, who would rather walk.
 *
 * The bridge is at 5.26 against a stack's 5.14. The difference is deliberate: it is far
 * inside `stepHeight` so it links in both directions, and making them *equal* would have put
 * two walking surfaces at an identical height touching in plan, which is the coplanar case
 * this map exists to avoid. It was 5.20 until round 2, which satisfied the rule against the
 * stack's *structural* top and missed its 0.06 m trim cap — the cap reaches exactly 5.20,
 * so the bridge and the cap shared a plane wherever the two crossed.
 *
 * ## What the bots needed
 *
 * The M3 bake linked two cells only where the height difference was step-up (0.35 m) or
 * ground-snap (0.4 m), so none of the above existed as far as the AI was concerned: a bot
 * could see a container roof, be shot from it, and have no edge in its graph that reached
 * it. M8 adds two link classes and this map is why — **climb links**, which the brain
 * crosses by pressing jump, and **drop links**, which it crosses by walking off. They
 * arrive together on purpose: climb links alone would let a bot mantle onto a container and
 * then stand on it for the rest of the match, which is a worse bug than the one they fix.
 * `MapDef.navClimb` turns both on and only this map asks for them.
 *
 * A column here can hold the yard, a container roof and the bridge over both, so Depot
 * bakes **three** nav layers where the other maps bake two.
 *
 * ## Lanes are corridors, and they are kept clear on purpose
 *
 * `LANE_X` is the whole discipline. Every stack, leg, stair and shed door is placed against
 * those three numbers, because the first version of this map was authored by eye and the
 * harness measured a **109% lane spread** — one lane 27 m and another 57 m, because two
 * containers and a gantry leg happened to sit in them. A lane on this map is a 3 m corridor
 * nothing solid is allowed into; everything else can go anywhere.
 *
 * ## Night, and the two bugs it surfaces
 *
 * Lit by six mast lights and one weak moon key, which is the hard case for shadows:
 *
 * - **Acne** comes from a low-intensity key at a grazing angle across a big flat yard. The
 *   fix is the `normalBias` this map overrides upward (0.055 against Foundry's 0.035) —
 *   constant bias alone would have to be enormous to cover a grazing angle and would
 *   detach every shadow from the object casting it.
 * - **Z-fighting** comes from stacked containers, which is the one thing here there are
 *   dozens of. Every stacked placement is sunk 0.06 m into the one below, so the two faces
 *   that would have been coplanar sit inside solid geometry where neither can win a depth
 *   test. The rule the prop catalogue has used since M4, applied to placements.
 *
 * Rotationally symmetric about the origin, except the two bomb sites and the four pitched
 * brushes (a pitched brush cannot be rotated by adding pi to its yaw — see `build.ts`).
 *
 * Convention: +X east, +Z south, Y up. Yard surface is y = 0.

     * The post-M8 pass moved the hemisphere 0.62 -> 0.95 and the report came back unchanged:
     * "STILL pitch black". The reason is that intensity was never the small number. Three
     * converts an authored sRGB hex into the linear working space before it multiplies by
     * intensity, and 0x323d50 — which *looks* like a usable slate blue in a swatch — is
     * linear (0.032, 0.047, 0.078). Against Foundry's 0x9db4d0 at linear (0.337, 0.454,
     * 0.630) that is a fill roughly **fourteen times darker**, so a 53% intensity bump moved
     * the floor of the image by an amount no eye can see. The old ground term, 0x232a34, is
     * linear (0.016, 0.023, 0.034): black with a rounding error on it.

     * So both colours come up and the intensity comes back down. The numbers below land at

     * these lights and the asphalt as it then was, the yard measured a mean of **4.4 out of
