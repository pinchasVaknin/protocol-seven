/**
 * The layout probe's page half (playtest round 5, P1; rewritten for M15, A1).
 *
 * B1, B2 and B3 were all reported as "it looks cut off", and all three were found with a
 * `getBoundingClientRect()` against a stated viewport. P0 rule 7 draws the conclusion: a
 * layout bug on this project is a **number**, not something a human has to notice, so this
 * mounts every full-screen surface at a list of viewports and asserts one thing about each.
 *
 * ## The rule: nothing scrolls, nothing is clipped, nothing leaves the window
 *
 * M15's rule for the front end is that nothing scrolls at any window size, and the mechanism
 * is the design frame (`ui/Frame.ts`): every screen is laid out at 1920x1080 and the frame is
 * `zoom`ed to the window. So the probe asks, of every laid-out element on a mounted screen:
 *
 * - **Outside.** Its rect is wholly inside the viewport. No scroll is attempted first — the
 *   old rule scrolled each element into view and asked whether *that* had worked, because
 *   vertical overflow was then "a legitimate answer to a long screen". It is not one now, so
 *   an element off any edge is a violation on the spot, and an element larger than the
 *   viewport on an axis is one too rather than a thing to skip.
 * - **Overflow.** If it clips or scrolls (`overflow` other than `visible` on an axis), its
 *   content fits it: `scrollHeight <= clientHeight` and `scrollWidth <= clientWidth`. This is
 *   the rule that sees a scroller — `.op-settings`' binding list, the editor's option list —
 *   and the one that sees the frame itself clip a screen that is over height, which is how
 *   A1's first measurement was taken. B3's *sideways* is the x-axis case of it. Two
 *   exemptions, both designed truncations of one string rather than a scroll: a single-line
 *   ellipsis (`text-overflow: ellipsis` with `white-space: nowrap`) on the x axis, and a line
 *   clamp (`-webkit-line-clamp`) on the y axis — the editor's tile blurbs are cut at two
 *   lines on purpose, and the cut is the design.
 *
 * One finding per cause. `getBoundingClientRect()` does not know about clipping, so every row
 * a scroller has scrolled past is also "outside the window" by the first rule — the first run
 * of this version reported one binding list as thirty-eight lines. An element that an
 * ancestor clips on an axis is therefore not reported as outside on that axis: the ancestor's
 * overflow line is the finding, and the row count is in its detail.
 *
 * Both are reported in window pixels, as the browser sees them; the content size beside each
 * screen is in **frame** pixels (window pixels over `--ui-scale`), because "1336 tall in a
 * 1080 frame" is the number a fix is written against and it is the same at every viewport.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * It renders nothing and starts no game. There is no canvas on the page, `WeaponPreview`
 * builds its `WebGLRenderer` on the first `tick()` and nothing here ticks, so the whole probe
 * is layout and computed style. That is the half of the front end a headless run can be
 * honest about; anything about how it *looks* is still a browser pass.
