/**
 * Everything that *presents* a shot, in one place.
 *
 * `Match.ts` is the composition root and was doing this too, until it passed 700 lines and
 * broke S3's size guidance. The seam is a real one rather than a filing convenience: nothing
 * here is gameplay. The round has already landed and the damage has already been applied; this
 * turns the events that fact produced into a flash, a bang, a hitmarker, a chevron and a
 * number on screen.
 *
 * Which is why it is all subscriptions:
 *
 *   weapon.fired  --> muzzle flash, tracer, gunshot, camera shake, latency probe
 *   bullet.impact --> debris, decal, impact report
 *   damage.dealt  --> hitmarker, flesh impact, damage number, hurt vignette, hit direction
 *   entity.killed --> the sound of a body arriving, and the player's own death
 *
 * Nothing downstream of the sim is required for the sim to run, which is what lets the headless
 * harnesses fire a full magazine and play whole matches with no renderer, no audio context and
 * no DOM: none of this is constructed in those runs.
