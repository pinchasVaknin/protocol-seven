/**
 * What progression *rules* need from whatever is storing progression (M9).
 *
 * S6.2 splits `SaveStore` from the rules that decide what an action is worth: the store
 * wraps `localStorage` and is client-only, the rules are shared because the server awards
 * them from M10. `MatchProgression` and `ChallengeTracker` are the rules, and both used to
 * hold a concrete `client/meta/Profile` — which dragged `localStorage` across the boundary
 * for the sake of six method calls.
 *
 * This is those six calls. `Profile` implements it structurally and nothing about the
 * browser path changed; at M10 a server-side implementation can bank XP into a match
 * result rather than into a save document, and the rules will not know the difference.
 *
 * Every type in the signatures below already lived in `shared/meta/SaveData.ts`, which is
 * the sign this seam was always there and merely undeclared.
