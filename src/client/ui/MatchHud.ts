/**
 * Everything the player looks at during a match, in one owner.
 *
 * `Match.ts` is the composition root for the *simulation* side of a match — weapons, bots,
 * damage, the mode. This is the composition root for the presentation side, and the split
 * exists so neither file owns the whole screen and both stay inside S3's size guidance.
 *
 * Its whole job is subscription and assembly:
 *
 *   killfeed.entry --> a row in the feed
 *   score.changed  --> the banner's numbers
 *   announcer.cue  --> a synthesised sting and a duck on the world
 *   weapon.fired   --> a minimap ping, if the shooter was not on your side
 *
 * Nothing here computes anything about the match. If a number on screen disagrees with the
 * game, the bug is upstream of this file by construction.
