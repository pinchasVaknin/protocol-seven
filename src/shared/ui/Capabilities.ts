/**
 * Whether this device can play the game at all, and whether it can aim right now (round 5).
 *
 * Two reports, one missing step. **B8**: pointer lock is refused, `Input` writes a line to the
 * console, and the match runs on unaimable with a full HUD and a running clock. **F1**: there is
 * no touch input anywhere in `src/client/`, and yet a phone loads the menu, is shown a table of
 * keyboard bindings and a note about F11, and can start a match it cannot play. The game never
 * asks whether it can be played here, and never says so when it cannot.
 *
 * ## The decision, and why it splits
 *
 * A refused pointer lock is a **banner**. A device with no fine pointer is a **block**. The
 * distinguishing property is *recoverability*, and it is worth stating because the brief offered
 * one answer for both:
 *
 * - A refusal is the **expected** state on the commonest path there is. `Input.armPointerLock`'s
 *   own comment records that Chrome refuses a lock for a window after the player leaves it with
 *   Escape — so pause, then resume, is a refusal every time. It is recoverable by exactly the
 *   gesture the banner asks for, and it clears itself the instant the lock is taken. A modal you
 *   fight through on every resume would be worse than the silence it replaces.
 * - No fine pointer is not recoverable by anything the player can do in the page. Round 4's F7
 *   made the protective call for the waiting room; this is where that precedent belongs, because
 *   here there is nothing to protect them *from* except a match they cannot play.
 *
 * ## Why the predicates are here
 *
 * They are pure functions of a record, so the harness can run every case without a browser —
 * which is the half `HeadlessClient` can normally never reach, since it builds no DOM at all.
 * The DOM-touching part is one adapter in `client/input/DeviceCapabilities.ts` that fills the
 * record in; everything that *decides* anything is below, and `shared/` still compiles with no
 * DOM library. Same reasoning that put `HudSurfaces` and `SpectatorTarget` in `shared/`.

/**
 * What the browser says about the pointing devices attached to it.
 *
 * A record rather than four calls to `navigator` and `matchMedia`, because the rules below have
 * to be answerable without a browser and because "what did we detect" is worth being able to
 * print when somebody reports that the gate fired on a machine that should have passed.

 * invariant applied to a new surface rather than a new kind of thing:
 *
 * - `wantsPointerLock` — the match is live and asking. False on the pause screen and in the
 *   menu, which is what makes the banner survive a pause correctly: it is *down* while paused,
 *   because a released cursor there is the player's own doing and not a fault.
 * - `pointerLocked` — whether we actually have it.
 * - `lockRefused` — whether a request has come back refused and we have not been locked since.
 *
 * The third term is what stops the banner flashing during the ordinary in-flight moment between
 * arming and the lock landing. It is evidence rather than a timer, which is what P0 asks for:
 * the state says *we asked and were told no*, not *enough time has passed*.
