 * different product from one where the players vote — and what is left is a scheduler.
 *
 * ## The tick, and why it is in this order
 *
 * ```
 *   1. receive     drain every socket into the input buffers
 *   2. instances   step the arena, then the live match, each wrapped

 * ```
 *
 * Receive before simulate, because a command that arrived during the last frame is for a tick
 * that has not run yet. The **flow runs after the instances**, which is the ordering that
 * matters most here: a migration that ran before the step would move a player out of a world
 * midway through the tick that world was about to simulate them in, and the forced snapshot in
 * Tier 2 §A depends on the ending instance having been stepped first.

   *
   * 1. **A returning player with a live reservation** goes back to the seat they left — same
   *    instance, same entity id, same side, same scoreboard row. This is F8's *"reconnect"*.
   * 2. **Anybody else, while a match is actually running**, joins that match. This is F8's
   *    *"join a match that is already running"*, and it **reverses §6.7** — see below.
   * 3. **Everybody else** enters through the arena, exactly as before. It is still the entry
   *    point whenever there is no running match to enter, which is most of a cycle.
   *
   * ## Reversing §6.7, deliberately
   *
   * §6.7 said *"a player who joins the server while a live match is running goes to the warmup
   * arena, not into the match, and joins at the next cycle. Warmup is always the entry point."*
   * The fourth playtest asks for the opposite and the amended clause is in PLAN.md, so the spec
   * and the code say the same thing.
   *
   * What the old rule bought was one seating path. What it cost is the whole of F8: a player
   * who dropped out of a five-minute match spent the rest of it in the arena watching a ballot,
   * and so did anybody who arrived while a match was on. The cost of reversing it is smaller
   * than it looks, because the piece that made the arena the safe entry point — the background
   * map build — is about **migration**, not about joining: a fresh connection has not built
   * anything yet either way, and `handshake` already tells it which map before a world exists.
   * A direct join is the arena's own path with a different `mapId`.
   *
   * `RUNNING` only. A match in `READY_WAIT` has not started and its players are still in the
   * arena waiting to be migrated as one; dropping a newcomer straight into it would seat them in
   * a world nobody else is in yet, and `maybeStartLive` counts the arena's sessions to decide
   * when to begin.

   *   that is not a code would send them looking for an operator they do not need.
   * - **The flag is checked before the seat**, so a server with cheats off gives one answer to
   *   everybody and never reveals whether the code would have worked.
   * - **`DEBUG666` never arrives here.** It is `CHEAT_LOCAL`, the client authors it, and if a
   *   crafted frame sends it anyway the toggle lands in a mask the simulation does not read.
   *   Written down rather than guarded, because the guard is the partition.
   * - **Every grant, revoke and refusal is logged with the resulting mask.** That is the second
   *   half of F14's *"make it visible"*: a bug report from a player who had god mode on is
   *   otherwise indistinguishable from one from a player who did not, and nobody can go back
