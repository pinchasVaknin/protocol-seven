/**
 * The stage (M15, B1): the player's skin on a lit disc, holding the class's primary, turning.
 * And (M15, D1) the same stage with a lineup on it — the winning team on a platform after a
 * match, each in the body the match dealt them.
 *
 * ## The same body, the same hands, the same call
 *
 * A figure is an `ActorAvatar` from `CharacterAssetService.avatarProvider(def).create()` —
 * the exact object `BotRenderer` makes for a body in a match — driven by `update` with a
 * standing, armed, idle `ActorAnimationInput`, which the selector answers with
 * `idleWeaponReady`. The weapon in its hands is `buildHeldWeapon` with the shared gunmetal,
 * the same asset a bot carries. So the operator on this screen is the operator other players
 * see, by construction rather than by a second model kept in step with the first.
 *
 * What it does not show is the camo. A held weapon is one mesh in one shared material, which
 * is right at the distance a body is seen; the finish is the viewmodel's business, and the
 * editor's SKIN tab shows it on the `WeaponPreview` that already knows how.
 *
 * ## One class, one figure or five
 *
 * The editor's stage is one body on a disc that turns; the summary's is up to five on a
 * platform that does not. They are the same lights, the same lens, the same loading rule and
 * the same disposal, so they are one class with a list of figures rather than two classes
 * kept in step: `show` is the one-figure API the editor and the thumbnail script use, and
 * `showLineup` is the same list with more than one entry. `StageOptions` names what differs —
 * the canvas, the camera, the platform under the feet, and whether it turns.
 *
 * ## Its own renderer, on the first tick
 *
 * As `WeaponPreview` does: its own scene, camera and `WebGLRenderer` on its own canvas, built
 * the first time `tick` runs and disposed with the screen — the main renderer is drawing the
 * menu's backdrop under this screen and a second context costs less than a second render
 * target and a viewport dance. The canvas's backing store follows its on-screen size, so a
 * frame at 0.58 does not rasterise 860×800 to show 500×464.
 *
 * ## Loading is a state, not a wait
 *
 * A skin arrives when it arrives (B0 made the wait a fraction of a second on a warm cache;
 * `echo` is preloaded at boot). Until the provider is ready the disc stands empty and the
 * caller's label says so; `create()` is asked once per tick and succeeds exactly once. A
 * skin that fails to load leaves the disc empty for good and logs where the service logs.
