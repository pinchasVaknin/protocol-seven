 * is a number in the same table as the benefit, so "is this a real trade-off" is a question
 * you answer by reading the record rather than by playing the game.
 *
 * **Resolution is pure.** `resolveWeaponDef` takes a base def and a list of attachment ids
 * and returns a *new* def. It never writes to its input, never caches, and never hands two
 * callers the same object — so two players with different attachments on the same gun
 * cannot interfere, which is acceptance criterion 3 and is verified by
 * `verifyAttachmentPurity` below rather than asserted here.
 *
 * The effects are declarative on purpose. An `apply(def)` callback per attachment would
 * work, but a table of multipliers can be *read* — by the debug panel, by the balance
 * report, and by anyone deciding whether the foregrip is worth its ADS time.
