/**
 * Draws the killstreaks that have a body (M9).
 *
 * Two of the six do: the sentry and the care package. Before M9 each built its own meshes
 * into a `THREE.Scene` handed to it through `StreakContext`, which is what made `streaks/`
 * impossible to load in Node.
 *
 * The reconcile-against-the-live-list shape is the same one `BotRenderer` uses, for the
 * same reasons: nothing to subscribe to, nothing to unsubscribe, and a streak that expired
 * between two frames still gets its mesh disposed. `StreakSystem.active` is at most a
 * handful of entries, so the walk is free.
 *
 * The heap harness's "a streak that leaves a mesh in the scene" test still applies — it
 * just applies to this class now, which is the thing that made the mesh.
