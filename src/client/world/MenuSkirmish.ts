/**
 * The fight behind the menu (M15, Phase E): a bots-only Team Deathmatch on the backdrop map,
 * simulated on the frame loop's fixed step and drawn through the dolly's camera.
 *
 * ## What it is made of
 *
 * The shape is `server/Match.ts`'s, which is the shape of a match with nobody at the keyboard:
 * the map's own `CollisionWorld`, a `BotDirector` over a navmesh, `DamageSystem`, `ScoreSystem`,
 * the mode, and `MatchFlow` — with a never-participating combatant in the player's seat, the
 * same empty seat the dedicated server runs with. The systems are the shared modules the real
 * match simulates with; only the wiring is here. On top of them, the two client pieces a fight
 * needs to be *seen*: `BotRenderer` for the bodies — the same skins, the same animations, dealt
 * from a deck of its own — and `Fx` for the muzzle lights, tracers and impacts.
 *
 * ## What it is not
 *
 * **Not `client/ClientMatch.ts`.** That is the composition root of a match the player is in:
 * a viewmodel, a HUD, an audio graph, a camera rig, a local player, the netcode seam. None of
 * that exists here, and a `Match` built without it would be a `Match` with most of itself
 * switched off. This owns the bots' half and nothing else, which is why it is a fifteenth of the
 * size.
 *
 * **On its own bus.** `Game.bus` has the HUD, the announcer, the killfeed and the audio on it;
 * a kill behind the menu must reach none of them. The skirmish creates a `GameBus` of its own,
 * every system subscribes to that, and `dispose` retires them the way `ServerMatch.dispose`
 * does — flow, score, director — so `EventBus.liveSubscriptions` is flat across a cycle, which
 * is the first of the three numbers this phase ships on.
 *
 * ## The warm-up, skipped in place
 *
 * Round one opens with a ten-second freeze (`DEFAULT_MATCH_START_SECONDS`), during which every bot
 * stands still. A menu that opened on ten seconds of statues would be a worse menu than the
 * dolly alone, so while the flow is in WARMUP the skirmish takes several sim steps per loop
 * step: the freeze passes in a second and a quarter of wall clock, and since nothing moves
 * during it, nothing is seen to hurry. `DT` is 1/60 for every one of those steps — this is
 * the `TickAccumulator.timeScale` trick, not a different timestep.
 *
 * ## When it ends
 *
 * A Team Deathmatch runs to its kill limit or its clock and then is over. `isOver` says so;
 * the backdrop disposes this one and builds the next with the next seed and the navmesh it
 * already baked. The bodies cut to new spawns — it is a backdrop.
