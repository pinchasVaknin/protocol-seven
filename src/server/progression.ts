/**
 * The summary screen's XP bar, stepped to completion without a screen.
 *
 * ## Why a fifth entry point
 *
 * The same reason `readability` is the fourth: this is a property of the **content and the
 * arithmetic**, not of a run. `stepLevelBar` is a pure function of the authored level table, so
 * one execution of this is a fact rather than a sample, and two runs on the same tree are
 * identical — which is exactly what the wall-clock-paced harnesses cannot promise.
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * A summary screen that never finishes its animation is invisible to every instrument this
 * project has. `HeadlessClient` builds no `ClientMatch` and no DOM; the skirmish harness at
 * shipped timings has never once reached a summary; and the browser preview never fires
 * `requestAnimationFrame`. So a bar that crossed the same boundary forever, replaying the
 * level-up flourish every 0.85 s, could sit in the tree from M9 to playtest round 4 with every
 * check green.
 *
 * What makes it checkable is that `XpSummary` no longer decides where the bar goes. The frame
 * loop, the flourish and the DOM stay in `client/`; the decision — advance, hold, or stop — is
 * `stepLevelBar`, and stepping it in a loop until it says `done` is an ordinary function call
 * with an ordinary answer.
 *
 * **The bound is the assertion.** A step count is not interesting; a step count that exists at
 * all is. `MAX_STEPS` is far above any legitimate animation — the longest honest run is the
 * whole curve at `BAR_SECONDS_PER_LEVEL` per level, a few thousand frames — so reaching it
 * means the loop does not terminate, and that is a failure rather than a reading.
