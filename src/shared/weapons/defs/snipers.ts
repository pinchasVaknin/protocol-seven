/**
 * The two sniper rifles (brief S6.1): one-shot to upper torso and head, scope glint, a
 * 0.35 s scope-in with visible breath sway, and hold-breath on Shift.
 *
 * **"Upper torso" is the chest box, not the whole torso zone.** The M2 hitbox rig already
 * splits the torso into `chest` and `abdomen`; `upperTorsoMult` applies to the first only.
 * That is why base damage sits below 100 on both rifles — a gut shot has to *not* kill, or
 * "upper torso" means nothing and the rifle is a one-shot to anything vaguely central.
 *
 *  - **KESTREL** is the bolt gun: 98 x 1.15 = 113 to the chest at any range you can see,
 *    and 1.25 s between shots. Miss and the fight is over.
 *  - **VANTAGE** is semi-automatic: 0.3 s between shots, but the one-shot chest expires at
 *    69 m and the pattern throws the second round well off the first. The follow-up is
 *    real; it is just not free.
