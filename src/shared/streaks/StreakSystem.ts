/**
 * Who can afford what, what is currently in the world, and the three M6 perk hooks (M7).
 *
 * ## Kills are a currency, not a threshold (playtest round 4, B9 + B10)
 *
 * This class used to read `PlayerScore.streak` and ask whether it had *crossed* a requirement,
 * handing out an entitlement when it had. The comment here said so outright: someone who
 * reached twelve kills held six things and could spend three of them. A threshold is not a
 * price — crossing twelve opened everything costing twelve or less at once, and spending one
 * moved nothing.
 *
 * The economy is a **balance** now, and it lives in `StreakLedger`: kills accumulate,
 * activation debits the price, death zeroes the balance. Twelve kills buys a chopper, *or* a
 * UAV and a sentry, and not both.
 *
 * ## What bounds a repeat, now that "once per life" does not (round 4, the pivot)
 *
 * B10's once-per-life rule is gone. Re-using a streak costs its price a second time, and two
 * rules about *time* sit on top of the wallet — both of them here, because both are decided
 * against the world this class owns:
 *
 *  - **The cooldown.** `STREAK_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` from the moment the streak's **effect ends**,
 *    which `StreakDef.effectEnds` names for each of the six. For a lasting streak that is its
 *    own duration plus the cooldown; for a mortar or a crate the effect is over at the press.
 *    Armed as an estimate in `activate` and replaced by the fact in `retire`, so a sentry shot
 *    down early gets its thirty seconds from when it stopped shooting.
 *  - **Concurrency.** A streak whose previous instance is still in `active` cannot be called in
 *    again — the ledger asks through `liveTicksFor` rather than keeping a list of its own, and
 *    the refusal is counted where every other refusal is.
 *
 * This class still never counts a kill. It folds `PlayerScore.kills` — the score stays the one
 * authority on what a kill is — but the number it folds *into* is a wallet rather than a second
 * opinion about the streak, and that separation is the point: it is what lets a care package
 * pay out and a cheat hand over thirty kills without either of them touching the scoreboard.
 *
 * ## The three perks
 *
 * All three M6 hooks are answered here and nowhere else:
 *
 *  - **Hardline** — `priceOf` subtracts `streakDiscount`. Every price the HUD, the purchase and
 *    the debug panel see is already discounted, so nothing downstream knows.
 *  - **Ghost** — handed to the UAV as `visibleToUav`.
 *  - **Cold-Blooded** — handed to the sentry (and any future streak that picks targets) as
 *    `targetable`.
 *
 * `Match` supplies both predicates, because whether an entity has a perk is a question about a
 * loadout and `streaks/` has no business knowing what a perk is.
