/**
 * MP_DUNES — the first M8 map (brief S6.1).
 *
 * A desert village at midday. **The sight lines are the identity.** Two outer streets run
 * the full 72 m length of the map with nothing but knee-high cover and palm trunks in
 * them; the middle is a block of fourteen buildings cut by 4 m alleys. Standing in a
 * street on Dunes you can see the enemy spawn. That is the point, and it is what makes
 * the alleys worth taking.
 *
 * ## The shape
 *
 * ```
 *                       z = -38  (TEAM B home)

 *   +------------------------------------------------+
 *                       z = +38  (TEAM A home)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why the alleys are a real route and not a token one
 *
 * Three things, all measurable rather than asserted:
 *
 * 1. **They are the same length.** The two 4 m alleys at x = ±7.5 and the two streets at
 *    x = ±26 all run the full length of the map, so all three lanes reach the centre in
 *    within a few percent of each other (`DUNES_LANES`, measured by the debug harness).
 *    An alley that costs you five seconds is a trap, not an option.
 * 2. **The centre column is a covered passage, not a building.** Rows one and two at x = 0
 *    are two walls and a roof with a 3.6 m corridor between them, so the shortest route on
 *    the map is also the one with no sight line into it.
 * 3. **Village walls are `plaster`, at 0.74 penetration density.** An alley is concealment
 *    from a street, not immunity to it — a rifle puts rounds through a village wall with
 *    damage left, which is exactly what stops the middle being strictly safer than the
 *    outside.
 *
 * ## The two perches
 *
 * One building per half has an accessible roof, reached by an external stair out of the
 * outer street, and its roof **overhangs the street by 3.3 m**. That overhang is doing two
 * jobs: it gives the stair somewhere to land without a gap between two walking surfaces,
 * and it is the one place on the map where a column holds two walkable surfaces — which is
 * why Dunes needs the layered navmesh at all.
 *
 * Rotationally symmetric: everything but the two stairs and the two bomb sites is authored
 * for one half and put through `rotateHalf`. The stairs are pitched brushes and are spelled
 * out per side; see `build.ts`.
 *
 * Convention: +X east, +Z south, Y up. Floor top is y = 0.
