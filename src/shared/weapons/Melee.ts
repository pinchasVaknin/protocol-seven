/**
 * The knife (post-M8 playtest; given a blade in round 2).
 *
 * The state machine below is unchanged — QA's report was that the mechanic "works well
 * technically and kills in one hit" and only the *presentation* was wrong. Post-M8 shipped it
 * as a weapon bash because a second viewmodel looked like a lot of machinery for a half-second
 * arc. It is not, as it turns out: a knife has no magazine, no charging handle, no muzzle and
 * no sights, so it is one static group and one three-pose arc. See `weapons/KnifeMesh.ts` for
 * the model and `ViewmodelAnim.poseKnife` for the swing; nothing in this file needed to know.
 *
 * ## Why it is its own system and not a weapon
 *
 * The obvious implementation is a third `Inventory` slot, and it is wrong for the reason the
 * inventory exists: a slot is something you *swap to*, with a put-away, a take-out and a
 * `raise` that gates firing. A knife is none of that — it is a thing you do while holding the
 * rifle, and the rifle is still in your hands afterwards. Modelling it as a slot would mean a
 * swap animation on both sides of every swing and a weapon that can be "left out".
 *
 * So it is a small state machine that runs alongside `WeaponSystem`, borrows its own
 * `WeaponDef` for the damage door, and lowers the rifle for the duration by the same
 * `fireBlocked` flag a grenade throw already uses. One rule for "something else has the
 * hands", three things that can set it.
 *
 * ## The swing has three parts and only one of them touches anything
 *
 * `WINDUP` is the arm coming back, `STRIKE` is the single tick the hitbox test runs, and
 * `RECOVER` is the rifle coming back up. The test is one tick rather than a window because a
 * swept hitbox over eight ticks lets a player knife somebody who walked *behind* them
 * mid-animation — which is the classic melee-lunge bug and is not worth the reach it buys.
 *
 * The test itself is a ray from the eye against every registered rig, nearest first, with a
 * world segment check behind it so a knife cannot reach through a wall it is touching. That
 * is deliberately the same shape as `Ballistics` rather than a sphere overlap: a melee that
 * connects through geometry is the other classic bug, and the world already knows how to
 * answer "is there anything between these two points".
