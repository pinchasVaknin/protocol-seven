/**
 * Match flow: rounds, the clock, and who is allowed to come back (brief S6.2).
 *
 * S6.2 draws the line and this file is on the other side of it: **match flow owns rounds,
 * the mode declares whether it uses them.** TDM says one round, no side swap, unlimited
 * lives, and none of the code below special-cases that — it runs the same round machine it
 * will run for a best-of-nine Search & Destroy in M7. That is the entire reason the
 * abstraction is being built in M4 instead of M7.
 *
 * Everything here advances on sim ticks and nothing is multiplied by a frame delta (S4.1),
 * so the match clock is as frame-rate independent as movement is. The clock is stored in
 * *ticks* rather than seconds for exactly that reason: seconds are derived for display.
 *
 * Three things it owns that the mode deliberately does not:
 *
 * **The respawn gate.** `respawnAllowed` is what `BotDirector` and `Match` ask before
 * putting anybody back on the map. It is not speculative round support — it is required in
 * M4, because a match that has ended must stop respawning people while the summary screen
 * is up, and a bot that respawns behind the post-match scoreboard is a leak of live state
 * into a state that is supposed to be over. `livesPerRound` rides the same gate.
 *
 * **The side swap.** A mode that sets `swapSidesAfterRound` gets its ends changed for real:
 * the team totals swap and the spawn selector starts drawing each team's candidates from the
 * other team's zones. TDM never triggers it, but it is implemented rather than stubbed,
 * and `__p7.flow().swapSides()` exercises it.
 *
 * **The killfeed's input.** The flow already resolves killer and victim against the roster
 * to build a `KillEvent`; having the feed subscribe separately would be two places that can
 * disagree about who shot whom.
