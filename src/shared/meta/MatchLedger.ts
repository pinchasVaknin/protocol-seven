/**
 * One seat's match, counted (M13 Phase B, bug 4.2).
 *
 * ## Why this is a class of its own
 *
 * `MatchProgression` has counted a match since M6 — kills, headshots, longshots, assists, the
 * time played — and then banked it into a profile and a challenge tracker. Every piece of that
 * counting was written against `PLAYER_ENTITY_ID`, because there was one player and one
 * profile. A dedicated server has neither: it has *seats*, each with an entity id the client
 * did not choose, and no profile at all (§6.9: no accounts). So the server paid a flat
 * `MATCH COMPLETE`, a `WIN BONUS` to everybody and a `TOP OPERATOR` to everybody, and nothing
 * for a kill — the reported "the server pays nothing for what I did".
 *
 * This is the counting, lifted out and keyed to **any** entity. `MatchProgression` still owns
 * the profile, the challenges and the banking, and composes one of these for the local
 * player; `LiveMatch` composes one per seated human and asks it for lines at the summary. The
 * two runtimes now count with the same code, which is what `MatchXpAudit`'s second half
 * asserts: the same events through a solo progression and a server ledger produce the same
 * lines.
 *
 * ## What it counts and what it does not
 *
 * Everything in `XP_SOURCES` that is a fact about the match: kills, headshots, longshots,
 * assists and the best streak (both read off the seat's score row, which is the one tally of
 * those), objectives (the row's five objective columns — Domination's captures had never paid
 * their 200, because nothing called `noteObjective`), minutes, the win and the MVP. The two
 * rows it does *not* price are `challenge` and `weaponLevel`: both are facts about a save, and
 * the server has no save. `MatchProgression` adds them.
 *
 * Per-weapon tallies and the described `KillFact` are kept because they are the same counting
 * and cost nothing; `onKill` is where a client hands the fact to its challenge tracker, and a
 * server passes nothing.
 *
 * Six subscriptions that increment integers, no allocation per event once the per-weapon
 * tallies exist, and nothing here can change what a match does.
