/**
 * The match intro's camera (M15, Phase C): the plan, played over the round-one freeze.
 *
 * ## Asked, not pushed — the chopper's shape
 *
 * `Game` asks `cameraFor` once per render frame, before it asks the Chopper Gunner, and
 * renders through whatever answers: this while the intro runs, the takeover while a gunship
 * is up, the rig otherwise. There can be no chopper during a freeze, but the order is a fact
 * rather than an assumption. Nothing here is written back to the rig, so there is nothing
 * for `Game` to undo when the intro ends — the same reason the takeover works that way.
 *
 * ## The clock is the server's freeze
 *
 * The timeline runs on `flow.phaseSecondsTotal - flow.phaseSecondsRemaining`, not on a
 * local clock: a client that joins with four seconds of freeze left gets four seconds of
 * intro, and the cue that ends the freeze lands on everybody's own eyes at once. The plan is
 * built on the first eligible frame — `planIntro` over the match's own navmesh and
 * colliders, the shape `npm run intro` proves on every map — and plays exactly once per
 * match: a plan that has finished, or been skipped, is not rebuilt for the same round.
 *
 * ## Three blends the plan does not know about
 *
 * The plan starts wherever the approach's trim put it and ends on a hold; the rig is where
 * the player's eyes are. So the first `BLEND_IN` seconds ease the camera from the rig to the
 * plan (a fast push out of the eyes rather than a cut), the last `RETURN_SECONDS` ease it
 * back, and the lens goes with it — the player's own field of view to `FOV_DEG` and back —
 * because a 90° eye cut to a 60° lens is a jolt the timeline does not need.
 *
 * ## Skipping
 *
 * Any key or mouse button skips to the return blend, except the digits that pick a class:
 * the quick selector lives in the freeze, and a class pick must not cost the player the
 * overview. `Escape` is left alone too — it is the pause key. In single-player the skip also
 * cuts the freeze itself down to the return and the countdown (`MatchFlow.shortenWarmup`,
 * M17 C2): the freeze is sized to the intro, and a player who has skipped the intro should
 * not sit through the time it would have taken. Over the network the freeze is the server's
 * and the skip ends the camera alone.
